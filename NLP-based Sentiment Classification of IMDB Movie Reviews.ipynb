The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.<br/><br/>Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.<br/><br/>I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - \"Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people.\"</div>\n",

When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry.

This is an emotional movie that emphasizes one of the worst periods in the history of mankind. I'm a big list person so anytime there's a list of the 10, 20, 50 best(fill in the blank) I must check it out. Now usually I'll take a gander at something jus so I can try to understand y it's considered great: 2 in particular I'm not a fan of include Pulp Fiction and Annie Hall. But I digress, this movie was well worth the years it took me to finally watch, had it on the DVR since March. All of the acting is absolutely stellar. I would say I hope an amazing story told on celluloid would encourage people to treat one another better, but given the state of things in parts of the world I'll say we're a long way from that. ONE OF THE MOST GUT WRENCHING MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN</div>\n",

Some of them shows you the worst parts of war, this one is doing something better.<br/><br/>Shows you the war is bad for everyone. Shows you een the little kindness is the greatest thing. Shows you \"Whoever saves one life, saves the world entirely.\"<br/><br/>I saw so many World War II movies, non of them gave me these feelings. Most of them are just too sided with USA. Some of them just made with fictional characters. And I don't know how but some of them says war is a good thing if you're shooting bad people.<br/><br/>Besides one of the greatest historical Screenplay, the Acting Performances just superb. I don't imagine any better casting for any character. They all chosen well. With Liam Neeson's Schindler, Ben Kingsley's Stern and the great villain Ralp Fiennes' Amon Goth.<br/><br/>Scores is the soul of the movie. John Williams mades you feel that.<br/><br/>Cinematography is too great, watching this movie with these colors makes the movie too much realistic. I don't know how is it doing that. I know some of the movies are trying that when flashback scenes are coming, but most of them are not being successful at.<br/><br/>Art Direction and Set Decoration is also too varied. They managed to do an enormous job. You feel the greatness in the movie with varied places and objects.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">History has proved that the old saying, \"God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy\", and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.<br/><br/>On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.<br/><br/>The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.<br/><br/>I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight \"Die, Nazi, Die!\" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.<br/><br/>Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and \"Schindler's List\" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like \"Schindler's List\" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life \"Schindler Jews\" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy.</div>\n",

He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.<br/><br/>This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done. When I first saw it in the theater, I couldn't help sob a little when Schindler breaks down at the end.</div>\n",

And there are times when goodness is as rare as lamplight in a howling storm – Michael Wilmington 93'<br/><br/>The brutal realism of WWII, countless crimes against humanity and the darkest journey imaginable is breathed into life in this epic adaptation based on the true story of Oskar Schindler. Directed by renowned veteran director Steven Spielberg this story of morbid ethnic cleansing, is of timeless learning for generations to come. Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kinglsey as Itzhak Stern &amp; Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth there isn't a moment of distraction from the matters at hand. <br/><br/>Oskar Schindler an industrialist and an obvious opportunist acquires an enamelware factory in Krakow employing Jews from concentration camps in the region. Hounding prisoners to invest in his industrial venture as he reaps the financial benefits, whilst the Jewish investors are paid their returns in metal ware. As the war comes with the Germany losing, the SS begins moving its prisoners Westward to remaining camps. Oskar Schindler invests heavily on Jewish workforce by bribing the SS for his own interest. As time passes his interests were in-tuned with the well being of his workforce than himself strident towards bankruptcy.<br/><br/>Performances that are brutally surreal and engrossing will break you down, whilst certain artistry of hand held cinematography will place you in the midst of all chaos and tragedy. Shot in black and white with certain exceptions of the odd girl in the red coat for personification, the realism of the morbid drama of the holocaust will never leave the audiences' mind. Up until 1993 Spielberg although is renowned for his creativity behind the camera certainly has not dealt with a screen play with such delicate baggage. A slip of the slightest would have this historical drama crawling, gaping for life at the mercy of its 195 minutes of runtime. Never is it so. With CGI at its minimal and the concentration on the subject, and the subjects' woe within the subject is where Spielbergs' heart is at. Enigmatic is where I am left as the end credits roll up embracing me with its moving score.<br/><br/>What took me so long to watch this? Is something I keep asking my self now. <br/><br/>Profound Beauty! If you appreciate art, this is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>TITLE: SCHINDLERS LIST DIRECTED BY: STEVEN SPIELBERG STARRING: LIAM NEESON, BEN KINGSLEY &amp; RALPH FIENNES RATED:R RATING: 09/10 RUNTIME: 195 Minutes</div>\n",

The realisation here is chilling.<br/><br/>The film's pacing is quite remarkable, it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly, but it's three hours that will live with you forever, some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.<br/><br/>What has always struck me, is the way that everything became normalised, people first losing their businesses, their homes, their freedom, and ultimately their lives, it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history, that's what this film details perfectly.<br/><br/>The Cinematography is incredible, it's understated, but perfect, fits the film perfectly, the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.<br/><br/>No wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.<br/><br/>It's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much, I'd say this, it is very upsetting at times, but it does also give some real glimpses of hope, the remarkable human spirit.<br/><br/>A jaw dropping, powerful movie, it's one of the best ever made.<br/><br/>10/10.</div>\n",

True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10.

The Nazi atrocity is presented in stark images of horror beyond comprehension and even the power of one's own imagination. The scene that brought that all home to me was the one in which the young Jewish boy made his way down into the latrine to escape the nightmare of separation from his family, only to find others had beaten him to it. Such desperation, such will to survival.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are superb in their respective roles. The filming in black and white is only appropriate for an era of history devoid of color. Amon Goeth (Fiennes) crystallizes the Nazi sentiment toward an entire race with one line to Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) - \"I realize that you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word\".<br/><br/>\"Schindler's List\" is hardly the type of film one can consider a favorite, it's reach goes far beyond entertainment. It deserves it's recognition as one of the best films of all time, it's power resides in giving literal interpretation to the message 'never again'.</div>\n",

This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country.</div>\n",

Schindler is played by Liam Neeson who gives the best performance of his career as a true real life hero for the German people even though he was a member of the Nazi party in real life. What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not only capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Science fiction classics like E.T, Minority Report, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws, but what he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his movie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into theaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam Neeson gives the best performance of his career, but so does Ralph Fiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no mercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting persecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names of the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable movie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a masterpiece Spielberg has created.</div>\n",

Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.<br/><br/>The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.<br/><br/>Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.<br/><br/>Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget.</div>\n",

Even the insanely long running time of 3 hours and 15 minutes isn't a bad thing. Every scene feels important. I would highly recommend watching this movie. Although it is very violent and very heartbreaking so be warned!! But if you can handle strong violence and a difficult subject matter such as the Holocaust, then you must see it. It's my favorite movie, and I hope it will one day become yours too.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10</div>\n",

Regardless of how much praise I include in my review, I should still think it deserves more. Few movies are actually able to pull tears out of my stubborn eyes, and the two that come right to mind are this one, and It's a Wonderful Life. Schindler's List is a grim portrayal of events in the Holocaust, while at the same time actually bringing light to some of the humanity still there. I was embarrassed when I actually started clapping in that classroom where I first watched this movie. I'd recommend it to anybody and it remains in my top selection of movies. Outstanding.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">'Schindler's List' is one of the most important, illuminating, admirable, and beautiful films ever made. It is also one of the most enigmatic, unnerving, and demoralizing ones ever made. This makes for a most interesting combination. What this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film, finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts, both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. And quite recent history. As much as I wish this were another story of some fictional premise, I would be in denial, which is exactly what this film aims to alter. Because of these very reasons, Holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'Schindler's List' remains as a preeminent exception to this. <br/><br/>I was amazed to learn that Steven Spielberg was behind this masterpiece. Apparently, among other great directors, Scorsese &amp; Polanski were also given the opportunity. And I am damn glad it was Spielberg who ended up with it. But I have to admit I would not have said this before seeing what he can do; apparently the variety of his talents. The same man who brought us the Indiana Jones &amp; Jurassic Park series. Where is the Hollywood action? The pizazz? The overdone glamour? Even his more serious films, Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, Munich, seem to be done by a completely different director. To me, they all pale in comparison to this film, which I confidently assert as the quintessential Holocaust/Nazi film. <br/><br/>Spielberg's choice to film in black &amp; white illustrated the foresight and vision of a master. Furthermore, his selection of what minimal color would be used (bookend scenes &amp; the young girl's red coat) was pure genius. It gives the film a timeless quality, yet matching the feel and style of the time of the events, rather than the time of filming. Whether or not intended, the film also drew parallels to Italian Neorealism, traditionally filmed on location, with some unprofessional actors, telling the stories of struggle and everyday life. The girl's red coat was a conspicuous way to make a visually beautiful statement. Our eyes are drawn to this unexpected, sparse, vivid infusion of color. \"Look at me,\" it says. \"You can try to be in denial, but this is really happening. You cannot pretend it isn't These deaths, this injustice, this wrong is not going away on its own.\" And, in fact, it is when Schindler realizes that the girl he observed so silently only days before is now gone forever, signaled only by her red coat, that he sees this and begins his dramatic character shift. The second use of color, in the bookends, seems to be primarily for the candles. Both scenes portray a family observing The Shabbat. In the opening bookend, before the start of the war, we watch two votive candles melt away into nothing; in a beautiful use of cinematography, the last of the smoke from the candles, lightly colored, dissolves and transforms into the black and white smoke from a train arriving in Krakow, Poland. A title card announces World War II. In the closing bookend, to signify redemption and the renewal of hope, these same candles are relit; color is renewed.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The first time I've seen it, Schindler's list didn't give me much of an impression. It was horrific, black and white, and I was 15. Now, after I got myself quite a cinematographic culture, feeling the urge to identify Spieblerg's masterpiece, I came back to this movie. I knew it was rated as one of the best films generally, ever, but when I took a look at the reviews, I became really worried. Most of the 1/10 ratings bring reasonless motivations for this film's criticism. <br/><br/>The main points of criticism that I saw are the following: 1) it manipulates facts; 2) presents a too distinct line between good jews and evil Nazis; 3) too emotional; 4) money grab; 5) \"Holocaust is bad, we already knew it\" (and this is an almost exact quote);<br/><br/>1) the claims for this point of criticism are that it portrays a positive figure of Oskar Schindler, exaggerates several aspects of the holocaust, and portrays essentially bad Nazis (we to this latter point in 2)); Let's get this straight: unlike some reviewers claim, Oskar Schindler didn't end up as an enriched Industrialist, as some reviewers wrongly claim. In other words, he didn't earn off the holocaust anything. On the contrary, he spent his entire fortune on bribes and corruption acts in order to aid his Jewish workers. He even had to escape to Argentina, as many Nazi officers did after WWII. As for the claims of overly dramatisation, that is certainly an aspect of the film. There are a few scenes which are not accurate (e.g. the shower scene - in real life, jews didn't fear the gas chamber as they where purposely misinformed). Generally, though, I didn't see that much of an overly dramatization. Most of the times, the film presented simply factual events. Jews were in fact killed and persecuted, there's nothing overly dramatized. Concentration camps where truly such bloody places as seen in the film. Instead, maybe it even downgraded violence quite a lot., still being incredibly bloody as a film.<br/><br/>2) Good jews vs. bad Nazis; I remember Hans Landa's monologue from the beginning of Inglorious Basterds, which centered on jews being rats in the sense that they're generally a population that could figure out a solution easily. Do not get me wrong here (obviously Landa stereotypes this immensely), but this is portrayed often, mainly in the first portion of the film. Jews going to the Synagogue to buy and sell instead of praying, some jews that join the police force and essentially collaborate with the Nazis, and some jews fight each other when hiding away during the ghetto persecution scene. I clearly would not say that all jews are good nor that all German soldiers are bad, but that shouldn't be a matter to be portrayed in a holocaust film. To see an avid jew, go watch \"A Christmas Carol\". As for \"bad Nazis\", I'd like to clear out again what is Nazional-Socialism. It was an extremist, right-wing movement that enhanced, in this case, Germany's national identity and superiority on the base of racial distinction, and urged violence on anyone that would not be member of the \"superior\" race. This movement, along with fascism, attracted a great deal of fanatics. I'd like to suggest the view of \"Novecento\", which similarly depicts the rise of fascism in Italy and its ruthless cruelty, carried on by it he insane and violent individuals which joined the party in the early twenties. I know that one movie depicted a Nazi soldier's moral division during WWII, called \"Onore e Lealtà\", which has low reviews for the same reason that prevents this film from portraying \"good\" Nazis: it is kind of dangerous, and can easily turn in a glorification of Nazis. Nonetheless, most of the cruelty is carried through a notorious war criminal, Amon Goeth. <br/><br/>3) Spielberg is of Jewish origins. As a filmmaker, he's considered this story very personal. Moreover, he is notorious for being emotional in his serious films. <br/><br/>4) It is well known that Spielberg chose to renounce for his fee as he considered it \"blood money\". Of course studios have to do a profit of their movies, but film is still a form of art. Movie makers of Spielberg's caliber do films without a simple capitalistic view of making money, but with the purpose of making an art work. Schindler's list is not a fancy action blockbuster, if nothing else, its black and white colouring identifies it as an art film. Add the fact the Spielberg felt personal about this story, and you'll realise how empty this claim is.<br/><br/>5) This film was released in 1993; I personally don't know many outstanding holocaust films from before 1993 (certainly a lot from after 1993), or if there were, they certainly weren't as bold as this one. A black and white film about a crude subject that keeps the viewer's attention for 3 hours and 15 minutes. Think about it. I personally believe that, unlike other films (this includes my favourite holocaust film, Son of Saul), gives a such wide view on the holocaust. This film shows most of the aspects of the holocaust, some overrdramatised, but nonetheless represented. It is really stupid to see this movie as unnecessary. <br/><br/>Conclusively, I'd like to point out that 6 million jews died due to the Holocaust. The only bigger genocide I know of is that of the native Americans, 18 million only in northen America. Seeing so many 1/10 reviews that base their claims on this being basically Jewish propaganda is worrying, especially considering the rise of right-wing ideologies that happened in the latter years. Are we forgetting history? I hope not. And, in case that's the truth, it's films like Schindler's list that remind us of that.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">There are people out there who will greenlight anything! That is the only explanation I can offer as to why the House of the Dead movie exists. And that's only scary part to the whole movie. It's so bad you'll go off movies forever. I seriously wanted to switch this off and turn the TV over to the Paint Drying channel but I was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing. I don't know why I do these bad things to myself.<br/><br/>As if it matters, here's the basic jist of the 'story'. A group of twenty-somethings are so desperate to go out to some island in the Pacific Northwest (Canada actually, because it's cheap) for the 'Rave of the Century' (which consists of about 8 people and un-raving music) that they pay some craggy old fisherman $1000 to take them there after they miss the main ferry. That's gotta be some rave to be worth all that dough! The fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the Island of the Dead (hang on-I thought this was HOUSE of the Dead?) and that they are all doomed yadda yadda yadda.<br/><br/>First faults here. Why would a tiny little rave (of the Century my foot!) be held on some remote island? Why would anyone willingly pay loads of money to get it? Why pay even more to the craggy old fisherman to take them back when they could just come back with the others?<br/><br/>Once they arrive they discover that the rave (which consists of about 2 tents, a small stage and a port-a-john) has been smashed, there's blood everywhere and no one is around. What would any rationally thinking person do? Run for their lives of course. But no, these clueless, obviously blind people decide to go look for them. Soon enough they discover an old ramshackle house that's 50 times as big on the inside as it is on the outside. Another half hour of stumbling around in the forest follows, as an excuse to kill of some of the lesser characters, and after much tedium they arrive back at the house again. The characters, like the movie, go nowhere.<br/><br/>Jammed into this ghastly disaster is a superabundance of gibberish dialogue, heinous acting, mumbo-jumbo exposition and zillions of clips from the once-popular arcade game of the same name. Why this was universally accepted as a good idea with the filmmakers I'll never know. The clips have no reference to any of the scenes and only degrade this trash even further, if that is at all possible.<br/><br/>It has nothing to do with the game save for some cheap, throwaway line at the end. It makes Resident Evil look like cinematic glory. Hell, even the Double Dragon movie seems multi-Oscar worthy in comparison to this junk. The only one who comes out of this with his dignity still intact is Jurgen Prochnow. He could have just taken his money and ran but he tries his best with the awful script and brings a tiny bit of pathos to his character. The rest of the cast suck I'm afraid. The characters are idiots and deserve to die.<br/><br/>Plus, if you cut out the swearing and pointless nudity, I see no reason why this film cannot be shown on Saturday morning TV. It's not frightening in the slightest. Pirates of the Caribbean is more scary than the skeletal bad guys in this film. And where did all those bad guys come from anyway? There were only a few people on the island to begin with. I guess this justifies the reason they chose to reuse footage over and over. I kid you not, you'll see the same zombie die a dozen times.<br/><br/>Who's ultimately to blame for that scandalous waste of celluloid? None other than director Uwe Boll. His control over the movie is non-existent. You can clearly the see actors have no idea what they should be doing and that the zombies aren't really taking it all seriously. The actors seem like they're reading off cue cards as they constantly pause in the middle of long sentences and carry on talking as soon as they see the next card. It all feels very unnatural.<br/><br/>Plus the film is shot like a two-part mini-series. I have indeed seen better TV productions. And don't get me started on the editing. The film is an incoherent babble with thousands upon thousands of pointless shots and dozens of meaningless camera pans. No real skill or talent was put into making this at all. It truly baffles and boggles the mind how movies this unfathomably bad can get made and George A. Romero can't even get anyone to take his calls. House of the Dead makes some idiotic reference to Romero in a lazy attempt to be 'post-modern' but it only irritates that they think THIS is in the same league as a REAL zombie movie.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, the 1.85:1 anamorphic picture looks great and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive and only serves to pronounce the heavily over-used ADR even more. The DVD comes with extras but why torture yourself. Isn't this review warning enough? Stay away! You are all doomed I tell you! Doomed! Doomed!!!</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">There are some movies you just know they are going to be bad from frame one. Even if you were totally oblivious of Ed Wood's work, one look at that commentator from \"Plan 9 from outer space\" and you just KNOW you are not gonna see the next cinematic masterpiece. Just like that, when I saw the first shot of Uwe Bolls masterpiece \"House of Dead\", with that guy sitting at the front of the house starting his introduction while trying desperately to sound like he just arrived from Sin City, I knew I'm in for a helluva ride.<br/><br/>So, the movie starts like this - first the lead character says that everybody else is going to die. You know, to keep you wandering. Then he starts introducing the rest of the characters with lines like \"Karma..thinks she's Foxy Brown\" or \"Alicia..my ex.. we broke up recently.. I had to study and she had to fence\". No, I'm not kidding.<br/><br/>Anyway, this bunch of 20-somethings who couldn't act their way out of a wet paper-bag are going to the \"Rave of the century\", rave in question being a few tents, a port-a-potty and a shoddy stage located on small island in the middle of the Pacific. Our gang missed the ferry, but thankfully will find a way to get there, the way being a fisher-boat ran by Kirk (Cpt Kirk? Get it? Man, whoever wrote this script is a genius) and his sidekick who is a bastard child of Simpsons' Cpt McAllister and that hook killer who knows what you did last summer.<br/><br/>To make the long story short, the gang gets to the island, finds nobody there except some bloody T-shirts and then decide to run the hell away from there. No wait, they do not, they actually get all happy and like cos there's free booze.<br/><br/>With that scene the movie hits rock bottom and then against all odds proceeds to go further downhill. Some guys in rubber suits start running around, there is some screaming and shooting, our gang goes to some house to meet some other gang, they go out of the house, meet Cpt Kirk and some police woman (who between them have about 500 pounds of weapons) and then decide to go back to the house. Somewhere along the line they transform into a S.W.A.T. team, enter the Matrix, the rubber-suit guys start multiplying like bacteria and I start to cry because I actually paid to see this. To add insult to the injury, every few minutes there are shots from the video game this crap is based on and there is a cute game-over cut-scene for a few characters when they die.<br/><br/>I seriously hate this movie. It doesn't even fit in that famed \"So bad it's good\" category. It's just plain bad. The script is bad, the zombies are awful, there is no tension, lines are bad, actors are bad.. the list just goes on.<br/><br/>You will probably want to see this movie just because of its reputation of being awful. Don't. There are bad movies that deserve to be watched. This is not one of them.</div>\n",

My friend unwittingly bought this piece of garbage (not a compliment this time) and we stumbled into watching one of the most excruciating wastes of celluloid EVER! When hearing that Dave \"Dead Hate the Living!\" Parker was to write this, I figured he would provide the fulfillment to go with the ever-so-slight promise I believed I saw in him earlier on. Maybe it was or wasn't his screw-up, but this is just unbelievable. How horrid can a movie get? A dumbass with a video camera (sign of the artist!) makes self-referential quips about Romero films to let you know it's supposed to be a real, bona fide throwback. When various characters die, it's made to look as if they've lost a video game. See actual video game footage spliced into action scenes that make Ed Wood, Jr. look superior! And, no, it's not funny because IT IS THAT DAMN BAD. Everything about it, everything! What a shambles! And don't make the mistake of thinking getting high will help you enjoy it... we WASTED our high on this piece of slimy maggot excrement! PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF WHATEVER ICON YOU PUT IN FRONT OF YOU OR THE LACK THEREOF, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! It WILL be a waste of your time and money. That is, unless you're even more into stubbing out hot ashes on your soul than I am! PLEASE! NO! BEWARE! AVOID AT ALL COSTS! IT'S JUST THAT BAD! IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME AND MY FRIEND, BUT NOT FOR YOU! NOOOOOOO......</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is one of the worst films I've seen. The only positive thing I can say is it was so bad that is seemed comical. First off, there's no plot. The actors appear to be reading off cue cards and do the dumbest things. Such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends. Also the zombies were terrible, no where near as fun as any of Romero's work, who gets s plug in the movie. And the dumbest part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences. Like we don't get the video game is about shooting zombies. Also, all the 20 somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun. And the way the people die is so stupid. It's like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on. And when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open, So dumb.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: If any of these actors appear in another film, then they've been blessed with a second chance. Definitely the worst film I've seen in years. A B-movie on cinemax is better.</div>\n",

I wouldn't want anyone to think that I paid to view it in a cinema, or rented it, or  heaven forfend!  that I watched it STRAIGHT.<br/><br/>Having played this sensationally gruesome video game and avidly trod the doomed rooms and dread passageways of The House, battling Chariot (Type 27), The Hanged Man (Type 041), and other impossible sentinels, my curiosity was piqued as to how the game would transfer to the movie screen.<br/><br/>It doesn't.<br/><br/>The banal plot revolves around a group of \"crazy kids\"  a la Scooby Doo  attending a remote island for a world-shaking \"rave\"  whatever that is. (You kids today with your hula-hoops and your mini-skirts and your Pat Boone) After bribing a boat captain thousands in cash to ferry them there (a stupidity which begs its own network of rhetoric), they find the \"rave\" deserted.<br/><br/>Passing mention is made of a \"house\"  presumably the titular House Of The Dead  but most of the action takes place on fake outdoor sets and other locales divorced from any semblance of haunted residence.<br/><br/>A fallen video camera acts as flashback filler, showing the island in the throes of a  party?! Is that it? Oh, so this \"rave\" thingy is just a \"party\"? In the grand tradition of re-euphemizing \"used cars\" as \"pre-owned\", or \"shell shock\" as \"post-traumatic stress disorder\", the word \"party\" is now too square for you drug-addled, silicone-implanted, metrosexual jagoffs? <br/><br/>It is learned that the party was broken up by rampaging zombies. Intelligent thought stops here<br/><br/>I don't think the pinheads who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the mythos behind zombie re-animation. Zombies can't die  they're already UN-DEAD. They do not bleed, they know no pain. Unless their bodies are completely annihilated, they will continue being animated. At least, that's what my Jamaican witch priestess tells me.<br/><br/>Which means that a .45 shot into their \"hearts\" is not going to stop them, nor will a machete to the torso. And a shotgun blast to the chest will certainly NOT bring forth gouts of blood. At least in the video game's logic, the shooter pumps so many rounds into each monster that it is completely decimated, leaving a fetid mush that cannot re-animate itself.<br/><br/>Yet each actor-slash-model gets their Matrix-circular-camera moment, slaying zombies on all fronts with single bullets and karate chops to the sternum. Seriously, these zombies are more ineffective than the Stormtroopers from \"Return Of The Jedi\", who get knocked out when Ewoks trip them.<br/><br/>I suppose the film's writer, Mark Altman, having penned the not-too-shabby \"Free Enterprise\", felt compelled to insert a Captain Kirk reference, in the character of Jurgen Prochnow, who must have needed milk money desperately to have succumbed to appearing in this aromatic dung-swill. There is also a reference to Prochnow's primo role in the magnificent \"Das Boot\", when one of the untrained B-actors mentions that he \"looks like a U-Boat Captain\". \". I wonder how many of this movie's target audience of square-eyed swine picked up on ANY of the snide references to other films, as when Prochnow declares, \"Say hello to my little friend\", presaging his machine gun moment. <br/><br/>Aimed at a demographic who have not the wherewithal to comprehend the Sisyphean futility of the video-game concept (i.e. the game ends when you die  you cannot win), this is merely a slasher film for the mindless and mindless at heart. Accordingly, everyone dies in due course, except for a heterosexual pair of Attractive White People.<br/><br/>A better use for this film's scant yet misused budget might have been to send the cast through Acting School, although Ona Grauer's left breast did a good job, as did her right breast  and those slomo running scenes: priceless! I especially liked the final scene with Ona trying to act like she's been stabbed, but looking like she's just eaten ice cream too fast.<br/><br/>Attempting to do something more constructive with my time, I pulled out my Digitally-Restored, 35th Anniversary, Special Edition, Widescreen Anamorphic DVD of \"Manos: The Hands Of Fate.\" Ah, yes!  the drugs were suitably brain-numbing - now HERE was some quality film-making<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Okay, so I'm not a big video game buff, but was the game House of the Dead really famous enough to make a movie from? Sure, they went as far as to actually put in quick video game clips throughout the movie, as though justifying any particular scene of violence, but there are dozens and dozens of games that look exactly the same, with the hand in the bottom on the screen, supposedly your own, holding whatever weapon and goo-ing all kinds of aliens or walking dead or snipers or whatever the case may be.<br/><br/>It's an interesting premise in House of the Dead, with a lot of college kids (LOADED college kids, as it were, kids who are able to pay some fisherman something like $1,500 just for a ride after they miss their boat) trying to get out to this island for what is supposed to be the rave of the year. The first thing that comes to mind about House of the Dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than an exercise in coming up with creative ways to get a lot of scantily clad teenagers into exactly the same situations. At least in this case, the fact that they were on their way to a rave excuses the way the girls are dressed. They look badly out of place running around the woods in cute little halter-tops, but at least they THOUGHT they were dressed for the occasion.<br/><br/>Clint Howard, tellingly the most interesting character in the film by far, delivers an absolutely awful performance, the greatness of which overshadows every other actor in the movie. I can't stand it when well-known actors change their accents in movies, it is so rarely effective, and Howard here shows that it is equally flat to have an well-known actor pretend that he's this hardened fisherman with a raspy voice from years of breathing salty air. He didn't even rasp well. It sounded like he was eating a cinnamon roll before shooting and accidentally inhaled some powdered sugar or something. Real tough there, Clint! I expected more from him, but then again, he did agree to a part in this mess.<br/><br/>Once we get to the island, the movie temporarily turns into any one of the Friday the 13th movies that took place at Camp Crystal Lake. Lots of teenagers played by actors who were way too old for their parts getting naked and then killed. The nudity was impressive, I guess, but let's consider something for a minute. These kids pay almost two grand to get out to this island to go to the Rave Of The Year, find NO ONE, and say, well, who wants a beer! Even the guy who pulled that stack of hundreds out of his wallet to get them all over there didn't think anything of it that they found a full bar and not a single solitary person in sight. Here you have the input from director Uwe Boll - There's alcohol! They won't notice that the party they came for consists of no one but themselves!<br/><br/>So not only do they start drinking, not minding the fact that the whole party seems to have vacated the island, but when one of the girls goes off into the dark woods to find out where everyone is (dragging one other girl and one of the guys reluctantly along), the guy and the girl who stay behind to get smashed decide that it would be a great idea to strip down for a quickie now that they're alone. It's like they expected to find the island empty, and now that they rest of the people that they came over with were gone for a little while, they would have some privacy since there's no one else around. Brilliant!<br/><br/>Now for the things that everyone hated, judging by the reviews that I've read about the movie. Yes, intersplicing shots from the video game into the movie, mostly in order to show that, yes, the movie was being faithful to/directly copying the video game. Sure, it was a stupid idea. I can't imagine who thought up that little nugget, but worse than that is the Matrix-style bullet time scenes that were thrown in over and over and over and over. After the first time (at which point I found it pretentious and cheesy for a movie like this to have a shot like that as though it was something original) it is noticeable more for the technique of the shot itself rather than any dramatic meaning or creation of any kind of tension for the film.<br/><br/>One of the things that makes a zombie film scary and gets you on the edge of your seat is to have them slowly but relentlessly coming after the living humans, who are much faster but getting tired, running out of places to run, and with a terrifying shortage of things with which to fight the zombies off with. The first two are done right in the movie, the kids are terrified and don't have a lot of places to run since they're on an island, but since they caught a ride over with a smuggler, they find themselves heavily armed. And I mean that very strongly. I mean, these people have everything from machine guns to hand grenades, which removes most of the tension of the impending walking dead.<br/><br/>Then you have what I call the techno-slasher scene. Since the rave never happened, and I guess since Uwe Boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing any techno music in the movie, there's one scene right in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead, and amazingly enough it turns into something of a music video. There's techno music blasting as the shots are edited together faster and faster until it's nothing but a blur of gory shot, mostly only about 5 frames long (which is about 1/6 of a second) flashing across the screen in time with the speed techno music. Clever, I guess, but it has no place in a horror movie because it completely removes any sense of scariness or tension of even the gross-out effect because you can't see any one thing for long enough to react to it. You're just watching these shots fly across the screen and wondering what the hell the director was thinking when he decided that it would be a good idea to put something like this in the movie.<br/><br/>\n",
            "I've seen a lot of people compare this movie to Resident Evil, mostly claiming that it copies the premise of it, and they're exactly right. I appreciate that at least here, as was not the case in Resident Evil, it wasn't some man-made virus that turned people into walking dead that were able to infect other people, changing them the way vampires turn others into vampires. 28 Days Later was also clearly an inspiration for this movie, it's just too bad that House of the Dead didn't do a single original thing, except for the somewhat moronic idea of putting in quick shots of the video game on which it is based, just in case you forget. I really think that this should have been a much better movie. While obviously I can't say that I know much about the game it's based on, just the title and the movie poster deserve a much better movie, but unfortunately I think that's more often the case than not with horror movies. It's really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a no-holds-barred horror film, and the scariest thing in the entire movie is the closing shot, which suggests the possibility of a sequel.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I'm not sure about this film. Are the film makers idiots or are they just making a film and marketing it to idiots? All I know for sure is that this is a dumb film....no, it's an offensive and dumb film. Everyone in the film seems vacuous and worthless--with dialog and actions that constantly reaffirm this. Their greatest interests in life are partying, cursing and taking off their clothes...period. So, when they all start to get killed off like in a Friday the 13th film, you really could care less.<br/><br/>This incredibly obnoxious and unsubtle film was, not surprisingly, made by Uwe Boll--the man responsible for many films based on video games. So, we have perhaps the worst living film director AND a film based on a video game...does it get any worse than this?! Viewers are treated to lots of blood and gore, many explicit scenes of vomiting and girls who take their clothes off for absolutely no reason. The latter is really weird, as the film was filmed in the Pacific Northwest--and people all were wearing jackets and long sleeve shirts--yet, in this bizarro world, girls just gotta rip off their clothes in some of the most gratuitous scenes you could imagine. Perhaps ut even then it might make sense if this were a porn video...a bad porn video. Instead, this crap was marketed mostly to teens and stupid people.<br/><br/>The plot, for what it is, is very simple. A group of vacuous and horny young adults(?) take a boat to a party on an island known as \"the Isle of Death\" for some sex and alcohol. Instead, people start turning into zombies and ripping each other to pieces. Yet, inexplicably, many of the prey know cool martial arts skills OR turn out to have high-tech weapons with inexhaustible supplies of bullets!!! The dumbest is the captain of a crappy fishing boat--who suddenly sports a high-powered rifle with a scope and laser!!!! What the heck?!? Overall, it's a movie with all action that's set to a loud Euro-pop beat. There is nothing in the way of plot, acting or caricatures---just zombies, cursing, nudity and death. If you LIKE the idea of a virtually plot less film with no acting or writing--just zombies, death and annoying music, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, it's a waste of time and clearly deserving its place on IMDb's Bottom 100 list.</div>\n",

Because I have to let it be known to all of you just how bad this movie is. It's unbelievably bad. Just to let you in on how bad it is, I'll offer this little detail about the movie. During scenes of mayhem, which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies, they intercut scenes from the video game. Yes, you heard me right. This movie really sucks. In fact, it makes me think about the fact that it costs ten dollars these days just to get into the theaters these days. And to see corn filled crap like this? There is no story to speak of and the movie basically has nothing to offer other than the occasional boob shot and really cheap kills. I'm really disappointed with this, knowing that I watched it. OK, I'm dumbstruck. It's so bad I can't even find the words. RATING: ZERO out of *****.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I found this movie in the 'horror' section of my video store. That seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there. From Romero's 'Dead' trilogy to '28 days later.' However upon watching it, you can quickly see what this movie really is.<br/><br/>It is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory. There is no horror here folks. Just some half-way decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last... and last... and last... and soon you get the feeling maybe you're DVD player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes, but no, this is how they actually made the movie. It's a pity. I think anyone could find a better use for $7 million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o' crud. Though some of the 360 effects were cool, but once again, they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt over and over again each time, just with a different character.<br/><br/>Also what is ROYALLY annoying is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game. I've played the game. It sucks. So why did they put it in here? Oh that's right, this isn't a movie but a music video, and it's a poor one at that. 3/10<br/><br/>Rated R: a lot of violence/gore, and profanity</div>\n",

So when I had heard every single critic railing this movie I was still optimistic. I mean, critics hated Resident Evil, and while it may not be a particularly great film, I enjoyed it if not for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shoot-em up with a half decent plot. This however, is pure crap. Terrible dialogue, half-assed plot, and video game scenes inserted into the film. Who in their right mind thought that was a good idea. The only thing about this movie (I use the term loosely) that I enjoyed was Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk (Ugh). While his name throws originality out the window, you can see in his performance that he knows he's in a god awful film and he might as well make the best of it. Everyone else acts as if they're doing Shakespeare. And very badly I might add. Basically the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you a.) Are a huge zombie buff and must see every zombie flick made or b.) Like to play MST3K, the home game. See it with friends and be prepared for tons of unintentional laughs.</div>\n",

This is by no stretch of the imagination a good movie in any sense, but you cant help but laugh yourself silly through most of it. <br/><br/>Plot line is this: A group of ravers travel to an island near Seattle, an island known as Isla del Morte (Island of the dead, and my Spanish spelling is likely incorrect). Once they arrive, they find the biggest rave of the year deserted. Why? they find out once they stumble upon survivors and are shown video footage of what happened. <br/><br/>This is really an elementary movie, poorly written by Mark Altman (who did one of my favorite films, \"Free Enterprise\") and equally poorly acted by the mainly unknown cast. Along with Jurgen Prochnow, Ellie Cornell (\"Halloween\" 4 &amp; 5) and Clint Howard (Ron's brother) are the only names I recognized. I really don't expect much from Clint (and he certainly delivered in that area) but Ellie and Jurgen usually do a little better than they showed here.<br/><br/>Johnathan Cherry is really dull as Rudy, Tyron Leitso's Simon is an irritating little weasel, Ona Grauer's Alicia is really nice to look at, but not much else...so on and so forth.<br/><br/>Lots and lots of pop culture references, including a mention of George A. Romero and the possibility of a 4th \"Dead\" film. See this one if you're a Romero fan...please...its a zombie movie and if the industry thinks thats what we want, then we'll get George's final vision that much sooner. <br/><br/>This is just not a good movie, but if you're like me and enjoy giving the \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" treatment to bad films, you should see this one. <br/><br/>1/2 out of 5</div>\n",

I knew I was in for something special when the guy at the box office looked surprised when we said, \"Two for \"House of the Dead\" please.\" He had a bewildered look on his face but gave us two tickets and mumbled the usual, \"Enjoy your movie.\" We went up to the ticket taker, she tore our tickets and said, \"Theater 4 to your right.\" It was then that I understood. Theater 4 is where they send the really special films, the ones where they are shocked and surprised when a human being pays to see it. Sure enough, there was NO ONE in the theater but me and dad. One guy shuffled in for ten minutes and left. He must have been looking for \"Kill Bill\".<br/><br/>The game makers saw the financial results of \"Resident Evil\", got excited, greenlit their version of it and added an overdose of \"Matrix\" effects to create \"House of the Dead\". So a bunch of morons head to a rave on an island. Zombies appear and the morons shoot them. The end. That's it. There's nothing else. Shows over. Finish your popcorn and get out. Beat it.<br/><br/>\n",
            "\"House of the Dead\" lived up to Theater 4's long standing tradition of B-movie ineptness. It's the kind of flick you think you should be enjoying a lot more than you are. There's blood, guts, zombies, a couple of topless women and guns. Lots of guns. So what's not to like? Well, if you stop and think about the incredible lack of logic, you'll probably hate this movie. My advice: Don't think. Watch zombies go boom, splat, ugh. Take the blood and naked breasts and kick back. Any thinking will ruin the movie.<br/><br/>\n",
            "Mercenaries with cameras made this movie. They were hired by the game makers to advertise their video game product. \"House of the Dead\": One long, bloody commercial. There is even a SEGA banner hanging over the rave scene just so you know who's throwing this party. Whenever there was a scene change, images from the actual game would pop up. Just when you thought the movie couldn't be any more shameless, it shocks you again.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope the makers of this film sent some flowers and candy to the makers of \"The Matrix\" because they were completely in love with their \"Bullet Time\" technology. Shameless again. The only original thought this movie had was to add screen shots of the game into the film. At least it was honest about its intentions: Sell, sell, sell! Buy \"House of the Dead\"! The game is more fun! Don't you wish you were playing it? Like...RIGHT NOW?!!</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is the only film I've seen that is made by Uwe Boll, I knew that he is probably the worst director ever who always makes films based on video games also that \"House of the Dead\" is one of IMDb bottom 100. But I still wanted to watch it because I'm a huge fan of the game and I wanted to see what doe's the film have that makes it so bad. After watching it I do agree that it is crap, the movie had no story. In the first 15-20 minutes there was nothing but topless teenage girls with no brains running about (for a moment there I was wondering are the zombies brain-dead? or the girls are?) then at night time the zombies popped out of nowhere &amp; started attacking people later a woman started shooting them I mean it takes you one place then the other every 5 minutes. Is it supposed to be a comedy?, or horror? or both? Before I knew it I fell asleep at the second half &amp; woke up during the end credits so I did not manage to watch all of it, which is a good thing! The film is a true insult to the classic game, Uwe Boll please do not make any more films. Thank you!</div>\n",

It's been sad learning about the decline of arcade games, but these were games that I always had fond memories of from my teenage years. I just spent that much time in the theater. I hope they didn't even have this in the arcade of theaters that actually showed this movie. This is in my top ten worst films of all time. I had heard so much about Uwe Boll and was interested in at least seeing what he had done. This is the guy who actually beat up people (in boxing matches) who hated his movies.<br/><br/>Honestly, I could challenge him seeing as how I have so much rage for him. The most insufferable thing about this film was probably how it contained stock footage from the actual games. I mean, they just randomly show this footage over and over and it's only one or two seconds long. What's incredible is that this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the games at all. You could literally remove the footage and no one would know it was a movie based on \"House Of The Dead\". I mean, I would think that if you included stock footage from the actual thing that you're basing your movie on, you would know what the game was about! It's the worst zombie movie ever made.<br/><br/>I heard this movie had one of the highest movie body counts, but it doesn't matter. In one long scene, they just show these monotonous horrible slow motion scenes over and over with all these terrible angles. The main character even flashes back to a bunch of scenes that just happened! It's about this island with zombies on it that's hard to get to. How can it be hard to get to when we see all these ravers there? There's a huge \"Sega\" sign begin displayed. It was as if this movie needed to remind you that it was based on a Sega game. It's more like useless product placement.<br/><br/>The movie ends with the main villain appearing and saying that he uses zombie blood or something so he can live forever. Wha...? This has the most random plot lines I've ever heard of. The budget looks terrible, looking more like a TV movie than a theatrically released film. Well, this the worst movie I've seen for Video Game Month and one of the worst ever. I still have a lot more Uwe Boll movies to watch! Remember, he literally said that he was \"the only genius in this whole f**king business\" (his actual words). Let's hope he never gets his hands on Mega Man. Zero stars</div>\n",

(We can't control the profanity undoubtedly being uttered by all of those watching this crap)<br/><br/>Now laugh all you want.. this review is idiotic and absurd.. and its intentionally so.. but at least this has saved you from wasting time of your life you will never get back from watching this load of total steaming sh*t (Seriously IMDb? Have to edit this word?? /facepalm @ that being as stupid and idiotic as AMC's butchering of films. Both pathetic and extremely childish esp since kids know that word very well by the time they hit school!) from UB... <br/><br/>Now as the title says:<br/><br/>OMFG will someone PLEASE STOP GIVING UWE BOLL MONEY!!!<br/><br/>Seriously!!! The man destroys everything he ever touches and some idiots keep giving him $ to make more movies..<br/><br/>Hell even his disaster version of AD&amp;D.. which basically writes it'self it's so fantastically easy to get right.. and he managed to butcher it to death in a horrific fashion..<br/><br/>They gave him Bloodrayne, AD&amp;D and at least a dozen others with potential... again craptacular garbage from hell every single time.... his touch is like King Midas only its CRAP instead of gold!<br/><br/>There seriously needs to be a public safety warning with everything that man ever touches!! Hell even his breathing or uttering the words related to any movie does untold damage to us all!<br/><br/>So for the sake of the children, puppies, kittens and whatever else you can add into that.. STOP GIVING HIM MONEY to make movies!!!<br/><br/>FFS <br/><br/>Pay him to NOT make movies and we will all be better off!!<br/><br/>Seriously!!!!<br/><br/>This pathetic excuse for a movie is just abysmal.. and while I've worked in the industry and am prod of some of the good stuff we have done here in Canada.. this is NOT one of them and the fact he was even allowed into the country to film this is worthy of investigation since it's an abomination to our film industry and whomever issued him the permits needed needs to be fired!!!<br/><br/>So review boiled down for those that want to skip to the end:<br/><br/>To quote the great Monty Python:<br/><br/>RUN AWAY!!!!

It's utter trash.<br/><br/><a href=\"/title/tt0317676/\">House of the Dead (2003)</a> is about a group of friends that ferries a boat to get to an island where some major rave party is happening. When they get there, the island is desolated. They think they have the party for themselves, but, of course, that is the beginning of their trouble.<br/><br/>This movie bases itself on a homonymous video game, which I think is funny. It is funny that movies love to get inspiration from video games instead of trying to recreate the video game's plot. I really don't understand.<br/><br/>Anyway. I'm ok with trash movies. Sometimes they are acceptable, sometimes they are even masterpieces. This movie is none. It's complete trash with plank acting and nonsense. Characters are just plain dumb and stereotypical. Dismissable.<br/><br/>Director Uwe Boll is famous for his video game-into-movie adaptations and boobies. Yes. About 10 minutes of the screenplay and you get your fair share. Bravo.<br/><br/>The ending is mediocre, but it has one final little detail. Nice touch. However, by this point, this movie is already dommed.<br/><br/>Totally not recommendable to regular watchers. This one is only for hardcore zombie fans. But don't quote me on this one.</div>\n",

Had the production crew turned into zombies when they came up with the idea of making it, because you sure have to be brain dead to find any enjoyment in it.<br/><br/>I am a fan of most genres and enjoy \"shoot 'em up\" games, but merging the daft scenes from the game just made this ridiculous and unwatchable.<br/><br/>As most have already said, there was hardly any script and the acting was weak. I won't waste my time describing it.<br/><br/>Anyone who rates this film above 4 has to be part of the production company or Sega, or else they have a very warped concept of entertainment.<br/><br/>I must say, I was more annoyed with the video shop, who gave this a thumbs up, which led me to rent it. Thank god I had a second film to watch to restore some of my faith in movies.<br/><br/>Comic book guy would be right if he said \"Worst movie ever\"!</div>\n",

But if you're from the future like me, and can catch this streaming for free somewhere, then it can be a lot of fun, even if it's just fun trashing it.<br/><br/>As the saying goes, zombie movies are like pizza, even when they're not that good, they're still kinda good, and video game adaptations have even more of a reputation for b-movie gold. I know nobody was expecting high art, but even within it's meagre aspirations, there are still some pretty glaring flaws.<br/><br/>For starters, it's hilariously dated. From the aggressive techno soundtrack, to the fashion, to the insistence on some very of the time visual effects, especially that good 'ol Matrix style slow mo bullet bit. It's also from the last era to put such blatant sexism on full display, to call the nudity in this gratuitous is an understatement.<br/><br/>It barely has any connection to the arcade game outside of the zombie theme, and tries to make up for this by including gameplay footage, which is the most ridiculously tacky thing since that first Doom movie did a whole scene first person shooter style.<br/><br/>To top it off, the whole thing just looks really cheap and generally has the feel of a made for TV movie. This is pretty understandable though as the budget was only *checks notes* twelve million dollars... wait, what? Where did that money go? I guess that Matrix effect ain't cheap, damn!</div>\n",

Uwe Boll is categorized in the latter, being in my opinion even worse then Ed Wood. This film is solid evidence of this, stuffed with laughable dialogue and silly teen meanderings, which prevent this from being in the same dimension as watchable. If you get your film inspiration from your favorite arcade game, then maybe your in the wrong field. Three story credits are listed for what seems like a kindergärtners project. A thirty person rave in the middle of the afternoon followed by stupid looking zombies somehow transforms incompetent teens into ace marksmen and markswomen. A creep in a stitched mask looks at people behind trees and when asking a question, one of the characters answers his own question in his question. In conclusion, video games are thin inspirations for feature films, arcade games are even thinner.</div>\n",

He's also really successful at both of those of those things meaning he's continued to make these movies and threatening to beat up his critics whenever they give him a bad review.<br/><br/>The story is a group of friends go to an island for a rave but when they get there the place is deserted. They happen upon a creepy old house, there's zombies, they fight and most of them die in the process. That's pretty much it.<br/><br/>The acting is bad. The overall look of the movie is bad. The entire process is just flawed from start to finish. And if you've ever played the game it's based on you will ask yourself \"WTF was that?\" because it's nothing like the game.<br/><br/>And the worst part of it is there's a \"funny\" version of this movie. Most of it was made up with outtakes or giving the actors free reign to act \"funny\". And then when that didn't work, they just added fart noises whenever you saw somebody's butt. Are you laughing yet? Uwe Boll seems to think that's funny.<br/><br/>Honestly, there's nothing worth watching here.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">As \"Sharper\" (2023 release; 116 min.) opens, we are introduced to \"Tom\". He runs (and owns?) a rare and used bookstore in Manhattan. A customer walks in, and we learn she is Sandra, a Ph. D. student at NYU. They hit it off, and Tom asks her out to dinner... At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the movie.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest from British director Benjamin Caron. Here he brings us a psychological thriller in which a con plays out. The movie is super plot-heavy so I won't say another word about that, but I will make the general comment that it's frankly impossible to fully grasp who is conning whom exactly until the movie's last scene. In other words: you are watching a film where you have no idea what is going on as it is happening. Julianna Moore gets top billing but actually doesn't appear in the movie until about halfway through. John Lithow is her ultra-rich partner. Briana Middleton shines as Sandra. The movie is highly stylish, and at times comes across as neo-noir.<br/><br/>\"Sharper\" received a very limited 1 week US theatrical release and then started streaming on Apple TV this past weekend. I watched it just last night. If you are in the mood for a decent thriller that doesn't break any new ground, I'd readily suggest you check it out and draw your own conclusion.</div>\n",

A perfect movie for a good evening in front of the big screen with a well written screenplay that keeps you interested in the story, and although it's a tiny bit predictable, well at least to me, it was still a good suspenseful mystery crime. It's about born con artists, about greed, about deception and betrayal, all good ingredients to make a decent movie. The acting was top and not only by the most famous actors. Everybody was believable with their performances and that's the main reason to watch this movie. The cinematography looked very professional.

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">A stylish thriller that tries to mimic the style of an '80s David Mamet screenplay, but falls short in executing the tough-talking puzzle movie genre. The film follows the story of Tom, a soft-spoken young man played by Justice Smith, who falls for a beautiful woman named Sandra. But when Sandra reveals her brother is in trouble and needs a large sum of money, the story spirals into a series of cons and double-crosses.<br/><br/>While the film is enjoyable to watch, with a succession of betrayals and twists, the story and characters are shallowly drawn and the dialogue falls short of elevating the film beyond its foundation. The film also tries to be too stylish, with a sleek production and lack of danger, missing the gritty feel that is essential for a successful thriller.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, \"Sharper\" is still a decent diversion for those who enjoy thrillers and the talented cast, especially newcomer Briana Middleton, delivers engaging performances. If you're looking for a movie that you can watch without too much thought and enjoy a series of twists, then \"Sharper\" is a good choice.</div>\n",

The acting is solid, the plot is appropriately twisty, it's not overdone in any way in cinematography or directing. It's just a crisp grifter story, and if you liked movies like \"Confidence,\" I suspect you'll like this too.<br/><br/>If I had one minor complaint, it's that the con artists here aren't faced with a lot of dangerous resistance through most of the story, easily finding non-threatening marks... it all looks so easy.

The real standout for me was the nonlinear narrative storytelling and introduction/background of each character. That way of story-telling is a huge risk and few can succeed filming this way, but these group of filmmakers made it work, and work well. The screenplay was sleek, smart and sophisticated. Each chapter elevates the previous one, and increases the already present scale of suspense and tension. There's enough twists and turns to make your head spin for the rest of the year. The story did have some plot and technical issues, especially in the final act, but everything leading up to the ending still stood out and impressed, especially if you just sit back and enjoy the ride instead of nitpicking minor details. The cinematography was outstanding, as was the score, and all casting and performances were spot-on and convincing. If you're a fan of Succession or Billions, this is right up your alley. A well deserved 9/10 from me.</div>\n",

Madeline become the inheritor because the son foolishly lost a huge sum of money so in order for the plot to happen the son should sabotage himself, the father would have had exactly that reaction, Madeline should stupidly take the gun and shoot Tom in the chest ( not head, not in the foot hand or air) and after that she would sign off the rights.

But since it's a 2h film, it flounders in its efforts to make us care for the eventual triumph of any of its protagonists. Everyone is grey-shaded and deceitful, and once the point is made early on in the second chapter, I sat back wanting everyone to screw each other over. And for what's worth, the Benjamin Caron directorial offers exactly that!<br/><br/>The twists start piling up rather unconvincingly, but the film never fails to engage you due to the presence of charismatic performers such as Julianne Moore and Sebastian Stan. I'd also like to see Briana Middleton and Justice Smith in a straightforward romantic comedy, if someone's willing to make that happen. The climactic twist is easily foreseeable if you've watched other con-thrillers or paid sufficient attention to the proceedings in this one. Folks at A24, you can do better!</div>\n",

It saddens me but I also completely understand it. Still, this movie was a lot of fun and is the kind of film I'm happy to accept will never be perfect.<br/><br/>The problem with the con-artist genre was that the audience became too aware of every move in the playbook. I never call films predictable - and I detest it when people do, because a simple possibility running through your brain at some point in the run time and turning out to be correct does not make something predictable - however this is the kind of film where I can at least forgive that word being thrown around here and there.<br/><br/>Which is ironic because these films were basically designed to be the least predictable of all the genres. They were designed to hit you with a dozen twists, each more shocking than the last. But soon audiences caught on that everything was the opposite of what it seemed and suddenly the films weren't as fun any more.<br/><br/>So anyway, back to 'Sharper'. We see the film from each character's perspective in different segments. It's a really good format for a film like this. We are always getting new information, but we are also seeing information we thought we already knew from a different and altered point of view. It does a great job of keeping the audience invested and on their toes.<br/><br/>The film has good dialogue, a good cast and great pacing. The two hours will fly by even though there is almost nothing in the way of action sequences. For a genre that some might consider DOA, I think 'Sharper' was a pretty good all around effort. 8/10.</div>\n",

Big issue for audiences and for writers is when you slow pace a film and then cram a whole lot of stuff in at the end. This could have been really good, but it's just not.<br/><br/>The premise and set up and tension for the first 3/4 is really great actually. Enjoyable to watch and you're just hoping for something great towards the end. Sadly what we get here is a clogged sink. It's flowing and flowing and then it starts to clog and by the end what you get is a clogged sink.<br/><br/>The water is dirty, there's no flow, everything is rushed and the whole movie is pretty much a failure. There are some good things so it's not all bad, but the writers sink clogged so it turns into a bunch of dirty water. 5/10.</div>\n",

However, I felt like this screenplay was very well crafted. Instead of being distracting, the device of telling the story from individual character's perspective and jumping around in time seemed to let the story unfold in a very natural way. Perhaps I'm not as well-versed in con movies as some other reviewers here, but I got so involved in the story that I honestly didn't see the final twist coming, and was very satisfied with how the movie ended. Finally, I felt the movie was very well acted, and I thought Julianne Moore did a particularly good job in her role. This movie is definitely worth a watch.</div>\n",

It's 2023, do people really expect every movie to come out and be 100% original? Or based on real events? It was an entertaining, dramatized and fantasized movie about con's who obsess over money. Yes there was times where it was predictable but sometimes I found this fun to guess and get it right. I was also was very wrong with my predictions and was left surprised, In a good way.<br/><br/>Overall some of these reviews are way too critical for a movie that you can watch in the comfort of your own home. People saying the script was off but I have seen plenty of other movies with a much worse script than this. I would recommend watching it, don't listen to some of these reviews.</div>\n",

Sebastian Stan also delivers a solid performance, but his character is underdeveloped and doesn't leave much of an impression.<br/><br/>Overall, \"Sharper\" is a movie that has its moments, but doesn't quite come together in a way that is truly memorable.

The film thinks it's a lot better than it is, being a very poor knock off of Mamet, and swings way too hard to be successful - missing wildly. Lithgow is also, of course, brilliant and Middleton is someone to watch in future. I really wish they had trimmed this down and focused on developing a real threat, and a deserved payoff. As it is, watching cons always has an appeal, even when poorly scripted like here, and Moore really does bring this from a 1/10 to a 5/10. There's some enjoyment to be had, but you'll forget about it almost immediately when you're done. Such a shame.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">A \"sharper,\" as told in the opening credits of the A24 and Apple collaboration aptly titled Sharper, is \"someone who lives by their wits.\" For the most part, everyone in Sharper keeps their wits about them. That could be what makes the film feel both like a surprisingly assured debut and as if something is missing. With a stunning cast, Sharper is everything that it needs to be - a sleek, neo-noir riff on grifters and scammers that is twisty and fun. But, just when things really ramp up, Sharper skimps on the chaos and settles for a neat ending that leaves something to be desired. Sharper begins with a simple love story between Tom (Justice Smith) and Sandra (Briana Middleton). Sandra wanders into Tom's bookstore, mentions Jane Eyre, and the two quickly fall into each other's arms. There's just one problem: Sandra's brother owes some guys $350,000. Conveniently, Tom has that (and more) in his bank account. Here, anyone who would consider themselves a \"sharper\" should begin to piece together that Sandra may not be who she says she is. The film wastes no time in confirming those suspicions, revealing its kaleidoscopic tale of cons and grifters in the upper echelon of New York society. After Sandra's con on Tom, Sharper quickly reveals the structure in which it is going to tell its story, a deceptive, albeit believable move through time and perspective. This kind of deceptive storytelling was a hotly debated topic after the release of Glass Onion and that movie's reveal of its own twist that relied on going back in time. For all its shortcomings, Sharper manages to pull together all of its cons with a finesse that could have easily been bungled in less capable hands. Even if it fails at its greatest con of all - pulling one over on audiences - it still manages to be a taut thriller that feels fully realized. Hollywood has long lamented the death of the mid-budget, original adult movie, but Sharper certainly fits that bill. That Apple is a place that is willing to produce these should come as no surprise. Instead of having an established catalog, the streamer is slowly building out one filled with its own original content. Sharper is at least a worthy addition to that library. The psychological thriller \"Sharper\" begins with an on-screen definition of its title word: \"One who lives by their wits.\" While you may find yourself wishing this movie, directed by Benjamin Caron (whose credits include multiple episodes of \"The Crown\"), was just a bit sharper, it's an engrossing-enough tale of con artists; of people putting on a performance in order to gain something. You can see why the cast would be drawn to this story: Nearly every character in \"Sharper\" is an actor, of the uncredited sort; almost nobody is exactly what they seem.</div>\n",

Left out what should have been the delight of revealing all the puzzles &amp; puzzle pieces like the far super Spanish Prisoner or even.the delicious Deathtrap. And of course Knives Out, Glass Onion by Rian Johnson. .The Grifters is also a great example of the darker versions of the genre and perhaps this movie was trying (too hard, too ploddingly) and very unsuccessfully to emulate that great film.

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">A well-made movie about con artists is always fun to watch, because it keeps you guessing throughout it's runtime with plenty of twists and turns and unexpected surprises; 'Sharper' is one such movie. This movie falls pretty much in the same genre as that of 'Now You See Me', a movie that I loved watching. I feel more such movies should to be made because they offer a lot of excitement to the viewer. With billions of videos turning up every day on YouTube, the viewers don't have the appetite to watch simple stories anymore, they want to be surprised, they wish to watch something unique, and movies like 'Sharper' offer them exactly that.<br/><br/>The acting performance of every single actor and actress was very good, with Julianne Moore and Sebastian Stan being the standout performers. It's unbelievable to see how gorgeous and sensuous Julianne looks even at this age; it goes without saying that she can easily give actresses half her age a run for their money. Sebastian Stan looked extremely sharp in every scene and reminded me of Agent Smith from 'The Matrix'. The movie made me completely believe that Max is a very smart person, which is why I found the final twist slightly difficult to digest. Towards the end, Max just turned into a cardboard character who just stood there doing nothing while his life was being shred into pieces. Also, Madeline going into panic mode and doing exactly what the 'security people' wanted her to do felt a little convenient.<br/><br/>The screenplay had me intrigued throughout because of all the twists and turns and also because it became impossible to trust anyone after a while as every single character turned grey. Apart from the final act, which felt a bit rushed, the movie does have enough to give you an enjoyable experience.</div>\n",

Its a house of cards of do you see me's, it has some original takes but also smitten by the germs of the past on this genre.<br/><br/>If you like good and magical filmatographic takes of urban environments, then this flick is sensational and some of the best i have seen for years. Do include the musical score, and most of the acting then youre in for a inglorious night of filmwatching.<br/><br/>I liked this movie, especially the intro section that gives you a taste of a love story, a love theme that buds the surface here and there till you hope it will succeed in the end. Its the life of the smooth criminals, which i, the grumpy old man,am not. So i liked it , therefore a recommend.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">No wonder they say that man's best friend is a dog. There has been many movies made about self discovery, finding oneself and this is one of the best in that list. Here our Protagonist Dharma (Rakshit Shetty) is the kinda guy who'd be hated by kids and families in the neighbourhood. But he is also the kinda guy who values his solitude with anxiety simmering below the surface. His seemingly normal life of is suddenly unsettled, the constant ringing of his door bells, presence of people, all for the uninvited guest, our snow loving Charlie. It's only when he reintegrates with his surrounding which leads to a beautiful, affectionate, touching film, a journey that touches on topics of life, pet adoption, overcoming anxiety, and most importantly love. Firstly, many will be familiar with the key concept of the film and it be no longer surprising but trust me you will be proven wrong.<br/><br/>From choo choo to naming Charlie after the great Chaplin, there are a lot of such touching moments in the film and i'm sure it will be very hard to hold back tears while watching. At the same time, the picture is a wonderful sketch of the soul of an ordinary Dharma and Charlie's last wish as they both find love, including a new addition to the family.<br/><br/>To conclude \"777 Charlie\" is good movie with very little flaws, also it is cleverly constructed love story, where the emotions are truly at heart and it perfectly sums up \"The tale of Dharmaraj in Kaliyug.\" I went to the film and knew that I would enjoy it and with a brilliant cast and a cute dog, which is impossible not to love. I strongly recommend to stop looking for similarities with other movies that shares the same theme and enjoy this wholesome journey.</div>\n",

After delivering critically acclaimed films like Ulidavaru Kandanthe, Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu, Kirik Party, and Avane Srimannarayana, Rakshit Shetty is back with another outstanding film.<br/><br/>777 Charlie is a treat for dog lovers and those who are not connected to pets will definitely start liking them after watching this film. The makers have successfully delivered an endearing and wonderful film. The film has stood up to all the expectations of the audience. The writing of the film is flawless, the emotional roller coaster ride gives you the perfect blend of emotions and drama.<br/><br/>Rakshit Shetty has again given an impressive performance and he never disappoints his fans. His bonding with Charlie is a delight to watch. The female labrador Charlie's acts and her eyes will surely melt your heart. The cameos by Danish Sait and Bobby Simha will be loved by the viewers. Raj B. Shetty, Sangeetha Sringeri, and other supporting actors were fine in their roles.<br/><br/>This is indeed A Tale of Dharmaraj in Kaliyug, which has been inspired by Dharmaraya's character of the Mahabharata where he reaches heaven alone and a dog follows him and he ensures the dog will go to heaven. The score and soundtrack of the film composed by Nobin Paul are refreshing. The direction, cinematography, editing, and screenplay, everything was perfect in the film.<br/><br/>The movies like 777 Charlie come so rarely in our Indian film industry. It is undoubtedly a worth-watching tale of human-dog relationships.<br/><br/>Movie Rating:\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The Man-Animal relationship is something an important topic or subject for filmmakers because it is easy to build up so many emotional elements into it. Just remember the movies like Hatchi: A Dog's tale, A dog's purpose, etc we can find that kind of technique which makes the audience swirl into the depth of emotion even though the situation of pouring tears. I also belong to that category and shed tears while I finished Hatchi. 777 Charlie is similar to it, which leaves us from the theatre with wet eyes. Simply, the story of the movie relies on the relationship between Dharma (the protagonist) and Charlie (the other protagonist) with some top-notching emotional add-ups. How 'Keaton turned Charlie' came into the life of Dharma, who leads an untidy, lonely life, and how the influence of Charlie reshaped and revolve around his life, etc, are the main things that the movie discusses. Hats off to the wonderful performance of Charlie. He is the 'man (animal)' who stole everyone's heart. Along with Charlie, Rakshit Shetty also did his part brilliantly. Kiranraj, the director of the movie shaped everything from his own personal experience (he said so in an interview) and we can see the wholeness of the director in the film. He indirectly reflects his love for the legendary filmmaker Charlie Chaplin through he assigned that name to the protagonist. And also there is a slight director brilliance too in the movie where he named Keaton first to Charlie reflecting his love towards another filmmaker Buster Keaton. Directly or indirectly he just reveals his passion and admiration for the legends, both are comedians in the public domain but more than that when compared to their contribution to the film field. And I also noticed something in the film which looks comical in its aspect and that is the quote written on the waste bin near Dharma's house, the quote states that 'One man's trash is another man's treasure' and that quote remembers me another one that I heard on a film which also hit the theatres recently and that is 'One man's terrorism is another man's revolution. It was from Lokesh Kanagaraj's movie Vikram. Anyway, that remark was only for my satisfaction. Come back to the movie 777 Charlie, it is a beautifully executed saga of a Man and his pet.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">777 Charlie is packed with all tropes of a light-hearted dog movie, including a tear-jerker climax. The first half is certainly more engaging as we wonder how an emotionless loner taps into his inner self and connects with a stray Labrador pup (the adorable Charlie), making him a more expressive-but-composed human being. These bits are also laced with situational humor and a sparkling Raj B Shetty extended cameo - a complete 180 from his vicious turn in Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana. While the bond between Charlie and Dharma is charming and full of warmth, it also moves into predictable territory in the second half. The dog competition parts did not feel essential to the plot whatsoever, and watered down the emotional core to some extent.<br/><br/>The foreseeable finale is also stretched beyond all measure, especially since you've been readily waiting with a box of tissues for a good while. The writing in 777 Charlie also comes from a hardcore pet lover's perspective, and therefore, while the emotions hit sufficiently hard, there's only so many times you can go aww whenever Charlie spontaneously hugs Dharma. I did relish the texture attributed to Dharma (it's shown that he lost his family while he was still a child) and therefore, the journey he takes in the second half with Charlie makes sense as he never got to do something like that (with a loved one) before.</div>\n",

Its Charlie who steals the show! I even cried to some moments.. Almost every one who has a pet dog can relate to this movie, atleast I can! I watched the Malayalam dub version, and to be honest, it was pretty good! Its just that naming the places according to the dubbing language makes me feel odd, like we know the movie is shot in Karnataka, but the names of places shown are of Kerala..</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is one of the best films of all time, not necessarily because of its story but because of the acting, direction, cinematography, lighting, and just the way that the story itself was told. At the time the film was released, the idea of revealing who the killer was in the opening scene was virtually unheard of, but it ended up being very effective because it allowed the audience to concentrate more on other elements of the film, which was the goal of Billy Wilder, the director. Instead of trying to figure out who the perpetrator was, there is more emphasis on how the crime was pulled off, what mistakes were made during the murder, who betrayed who, how close Barton Keyes (the insurance investigator) was getting to solving the case, and, probably most importantly, what kind of person Walter Neff is and whether or not sympathy should be felt toward him.<br/><br/>\n",
            "Barbara Stanwyck, in one of the most remembered performances of her extensive career, represents (with nearly flawless ease) the cold and ruthless manipulator who has no difficulty in ruining other people's lives in various ways (including death, if necessary) in order to get what she wants. Known in the film community as the `femme fatale,' this is someone who uses her sexual prowess, seductiveness, and emotional detachment to drag an unsuspecting person (generally an interested man) into a scheme from which she is expected to benefit heavily and he is most likely headed for destruction. In these types of films, the man often either finds his life in ruins or ends up dead, as is often (but not always) also the case with the fate of the femme fatale. <br/><br/>Barbara Stanwyck (as Phyllis Dietrichson, the murderous femme fatale in Double Indemnity) and Fred MacMurray (as Walter Neff, her victim'), have amazing chemistry on screen. Their attraction is incredibly well portrayed, and the development of their relationship with each other is so convincing that what happens between them almost seems normal. Besides that, their mutually calculated interaction, although it seems at first like it has been rehearsed endlessly and ultimately brought unconvincingly to the screen, is exactly as it was meant to be, because it represents each character's intentions, even very subtly foreshadowing their future betrayals against each other. Phyllis has gone through every word she ever says to Walter in her head. She has practiced what she wants to say when she brings up the idea of life insurance to Walter in the beginning and she knows what she wants to say whenever they interact with each other because she has been planning for quite some time the prospect of murdering her husband in order to collect his fortune. Walter, conversely, methodically makes amorous advances as though this is something that he does regularly, and then ultimately he also plans out his conversations with Phyllis because he begins to suspect her and is sure to tell her only what he wants her to hear. This seemingly stiff dialogue brilliantly represents Phyllis and Walter's precise (and sinister) intentions, and it's quick pace creates a feeling of urgency and restlessness.<br/><br/>Probably the most fascinating and entertaining actor in the film, Edward G. Robinson, plays Barton Keyes, Walter's friend and employer at the insurance company where he works. Keyes is a very suspicious man who closely investigates the insurance claims which come into the company, having a striking history of accurately isolating fraudulent claims and throwing them out. His handling of Phyllis's (and Walter's, technically) claim and the way that he gets closer and closer to the truth create a great atmosphere of tension and drama. <br/><br/>Double Indemnity is nearly flawless. From the shocking and unexpected beginning to the already known but still surprising end, the audience is held rapt by the excellent performances, the brilliant and imaginative direction, and the flawlessly created atmosphere. This is excellent, excellent filmmaking, and is a classic film that should not be missed.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is one of the best-liked classic films of all time and I am among that large group of fans as well.<br/><br/>Few movies have ever had dialog this entertaining.....at least the conversations between Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. I think it's a big appeal to this movie, except to younger folks who look at it as \"cheesy.\"<br/><br/>I read the book, Double Indemnity written by James Cain, and was surprised that the film's snappy dialog was not in it. This is one of the rare times when the movie was far better than the book. That's not a shock after you find out that literary giant Raymond Chandler and Hall Of Fame director Billy Wilder combined to write the screenplay,<br/><br/>For a murder/suspense story, there is very little action, almost none, yet there are no boring lulls. The three main actors - Stanwyck, MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson, are what make this so good.<br/><br/>MacMurray's narration is fun to hear as he tells the story in flashback, from the beginning by dictating into an old Dictaphone to his co-worker Robinson. The latter is almost mesmerizing in his performance, the way he delivers his lines. He can even make a speech about something as boring as insurance and still keep you riveted to the screen.<br/><br/>Stanwyck was no sex symbol (at least to me) but she looked great here in the most seductive of 1940s clothing and, like Robinson, has a distinctive voice and accent that keeps your attention.<br/><br/>This film was the inspiration for the 1980 movie, \"Body Heat,\" starring William Hurt and Kathleen Turner. That, too, was a very, very good movie....but not many films are in the class of this one.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Vintage Noir Film with gritty interpretation , atmospheric settings , crackling dialogue throughout and powerhouse filmmaking . This Billy Wilder's first thriller is one of the finest Noir film ever made . A scheming wife (Barbara Stanwyck) lures an insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray , though Alan Ladd, George Raft, Brian Donlevy, James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, Gregory Peck, and Fredric March were all up for the leading role) into helping murder her husband and then declare it an accident . Both of whom concoct a twisted scheme to collect the benefits of a insurance policy . As the hubby's policy contains a clause that states that if the husband's death caused by a moving train the policy pays double face value . The investigator's boss (Edward G. Robinson) , not knowing his colleague is involved in it , suspects murder and sets out to prove it .<br/><br/>This first-rate and entertaining American classic Noir film draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as drama , emotion and moody atmosphere . This classic mystery thriller follows James M Cain's book fairly closely otherwise . Twisted film Noir about murder , troubled relationships , treason , dark secrets , including an unforgettable dialog ; being based on the James M Cain's novel , which in turn was based on the true story of Ruth Snyder, the subject of a notorious 1920s murder trial , being screen-written by the prestigious Raymond Chandler and the same Billy Wilder . However , Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler did not get along well while writing this film's script, a process that was apparently filled with arguments . As Billy Wilder didn't really get on with the famous novelist whose constant drinking irritated the director . It packs a good realization , an original script , haunting atmosphere , intriguing events ; for that reason madness and murder prevail . Fred MacMurray is superb as insurance salesman coerced into murder plot and Barbara Stanwick as predatory and alluring Femme Fatale is magnificent . Here his colleague Edward G Robinson is extraordinary and as cool as ever ; he plays as the astute and stubborn investigator , his scenes with Fred MacMurray are awesome and at their best . But Edward G. Robinson's initial reluctance to sign on largely stemmed from the fact he wasn't keen on being demoted to third lead . Good support cast formed by notorious secondaries such as Porter Hall , Tom Powers , Jean Heather , Byron Barr and Fortunio Bonanova . And Raymond Chandler's cameo , this marks the only film appearance of screenwriter and novelist Raymond Chandler .<br/><br/>Exciting as well as complex film , possessing a mysterious and fascinating blend of gripping thriller , serenity , baroque suspense in which especially stands out the portentous performances , evocative cinematography in black and white by John F. Seitz and thrilling musical score by the classic Miklos Rozsa . The motion picture was stunningly directed by the great Billy Wilder , as the American Film Institute ranked this as the #29 Greatest Movie of All Time . The film was nominated for 7 Academy Awards but lost out on the night to Going my way (1944) by Leo McCarey. It got a deep inspiration for other films , it is particularly obvious for ¨Body heat¨ by Lawrence Kasdan with William Hurt , Kathleen Turner and Richard Crenna . Remade for TV in 1954 by Buzz Kulik with Frank Lovejoy , Ray Collins and Laraine Day , and 1973 TV remake of the 1940s classic by Jack Smight with Richard Crenna , Samantha Eggar , and Robert Webber .</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">There are occasional times when all the elements come together to make a great film that will stand the passing of time. \"Double Indemnity\" seems to be an example of this phenomenon.<br/><br/>First, there was a great novel by one of America's best mystery writers, James Cain, who created these characters that seem will live forever in our imagination. Then, the lucky break in getting the right man to direct it, Billy Wilder, a man who knew about how to make a classic out of the material that he adapted with great care and elegance with Raymond Chandler, a man who knew about the genre.<br/><br/>\"Double Indemnity\" works because it's a story we can relate to. There is a greedy woman trapped in a bad marriage, who sees the opportunity when she encounters an insurance agent who is instantly smitten with her and who has only sex in his mind. The manipulator, Phyllis Dietrichson, doesn't need much to see how Walter desires her. His idea of having her husband sign an insurance policy he knows nothing about, thinking he is doing something else, will prove a fatal flaw in judgment.<br/><br/>Mr. Wilder achieves in this film what others try, with disastrous results. The director, who was working under the old Hays Code, shows so much sex in the film with fully clothed actors, yet one feels the heat exuding from the passion Walter Neff feels for Phyllis. He is a man that will throw everything away because he is blinded by the promise of what his life will be once the husband is out of the picture.<br/><br/>In life, as well as in fiction, there are small and insignificant things that will derail the best laid plans. First, there i Jackson, the man who shouldn't have been smoking at the rear of the train, contemplating the passing landscape. Then, no one counts in the ability of Barton Keys, the man in the agency who has seen it all! Walter and Phyllis didn't take that into consideration and it will backfire on their plan.<br/><br/>We try to make a point to take a look at \"Double Indemnity\" when it shows on cable from time to time. Barbara Stanwyck makes a magnificent Phyllis. There are no false movements in her performance. Phyllis gets under Walter's skin because she knows where her priorities lie and makes good use of them in order to render Walter helpless under her spell.<br/><br/>Fred McMurray makes a perfect Walter. He is consumed by his passion and he will do anything because of what he perceives will be the reward for doing the crime. Walter Neff was perhaps Mr. McMurray's best creation. He is completely believable and vulnerable.<br/><br/>Edgar G. Robinson, as Barton Keys, makes one of his best performances for the screen. Keys is a man that has seen all the schemes pass by his desk. He is, in a way, Walter's worst nightmare, because working next to Keys, he gets to know how wrong he was in the planning of the crime.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is excellent. Porter Hall, Jean Heather, Tom Powers, Richard Gaines, Fortunio Buonanova and John Philliber are perfect.<br/><br/>The music score of Miklos Rosza gives the film a texture and a dimension that capitalizes on the action it intends to enhance. Also the music of Cesar Franck and Franz Schubert contribute to the atmosphere of the movie. The great cinematography of John Seitz, who will go on to direct films, is another asset in the movie. Edith Head's costumes are absolutely what a woman like Phyllis would wear right down to her ankle bracelet.<br/><br/>This film shows a great man at his best: Billy Wilder!</div>\n",

Walter Neff's already boarded that long, lonely trolley down the one-way track. Yes indeed, sultry Phyllis appears to be just the ticket he's been looking for. Great noir classic. All in all, Neff should have paid attention to that other member of the oddball triangle. Old man Keyes may be a born cynic, but despite himself, he's a father figure looking for a son to take his place, and warning Neff about the \"Margie's\" of the world. What he doesn't know is that this \"Margie\" definitely doesn't drink out of a bottle. What's more, Neff's already chosen to ride with the flashy crowd, get out of that dumpy apartment, and get into Phyllis's vicious little insurance swindle. As Keyes tellingly remarks, \"You're not smarter than the rest, Walter, just a little taller.\" I like to think that Walter finally realizes his folly in that brilliant final scene, even if it is too late. Still, the film's cynical veneer is misleading. Because beneath all the deceits, betrayals, and ironies, lies a lighted match and one of the odder father-son relationships in Hollywood annals.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I've now seen this movie 14 times in 25 years, at all times of the year, in all moods, sober or not etc - but always at night. I recorded my copy off TV in 1987 so I can only imagine what a remaster would do for it. With an atmosphere thick enough to cut with a knife it never fails to engross and enchant me, and although it's been dated for 40 years or more still seems relevant and watchable today. TV, answer phones, recordable CD/DVD, memory sticks and the internet have all come between us and yet I can still watch Fred MacMurray speaking into a Dictaphone without a qualm. Who wears a hat in California nowadays? Who buys beer whilst driving! Lift attendants have gone but I can still believe in Charlie working and laughing away in the garage past 11 at night.<br/><br/>Woman and man agree to murder woman's husband but on the way to the cemetery they face grilling by insurance company. I think everything has been said before on the IMDb - by those who think it's one of the best films ever made! To those who simply think the main problem is that it's dated I wish you could see the TV commercials that dug into DI back in '87 - what a hoot - and compare. I've just noticed the print TCM UK is showing in 2005 is lip-synced out, very wobbly Rosza music track, fading and ageing fast - worse than my 1987 video tape (maybe logically). They're supposed to be encouraging people to enjoy the classics but they won't do that with such inferior screening copies. Dear TCM UK, this is an impressive iconic film - it deserves a billion dollar remaster authorised by the Library of Congress, not repeatedly trotting out unimpressive cheap worn dupes to fill those 2 hour slots.<br/><br/>Everything about DI from the acting, production, direction, and music is superbly dignified and is as \"close to perfection\" as human beings are probably allowed to get with this form of Art - especially with the more limited technology at their disposal in '44. When most films from now are long forgotten and dated DI will still be getting re-runs on TV and art-house cinemas - God and remasters willing - that is the fact of it.<br/><br/>Fortunia Bonanova certainly was fortunate to have appeared in bit parts in 2 of the best films ever made - Citizen Kane the other.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Wow--this movie had the absolute snappiest dialog of any Film Noir movie in Hollywood history. For dialog alone and Fred MacMurray's voice-overs, this must rank as one of the best Noir films of all time. The words they say are all so carefully chosen and magnificent--the writers really did their work well. And, the acting and direction are excellent as well. About the only reason I don't score it a 10 (and it sure came very close) was that, for Film Noir, there wasn't a whole lot of action or even suspense in the movie--considering you KNOW that MacMurray is making a confession so he isn't going to get away with the murder plot. Still, these are VERY minor complaints--the film is simply great. I suggest after seeing this film you watch an episode of MY THREE SONS and see the two extremes in Fred's work--the absolute apex and the absolute nadir (if you don't know what those words mean, look 'em up yourself, ya mug).</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Author James M. Cain virtually created a new genre with his extra-tough, sin-blackened, and sex-drenched novels--and they were so successful with the public that not even 1940s Hollywood could resist. The result was three of the most famous films of that decade: MILDRED PIERCE, THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE, and DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Although POSTMAN is probably the better film, INDEMNITY is the most famous--possibly due to the story's truly psychotic edge, which is given full life by Barbara Stanwyck in one of her most celebrated performances.<br/><br/>Like POSTMAN, INDEMNITY offers the story of a married woman who plots with her lover to murder her husband. Given MacMurray's typically \"good guy\" image, I didn't expect to believe him in the role of Walter Neff in the role of skirt-hungry Walter Neff--but MacMurray's performance is exceptionally good here, and all the more effective because it so completely unexpected. But while MacMurray has most of the screen time, it is really Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson who dominate the film. Stanwyck is truly memorable here, and gives us a woman who seems at once sexed-up and completely frigid, at once completely natural and absolutely artificial. It is a remarkable and often disturbing effect. Robinson, who endured decades of type-casting, is equally good as the blustery, slightly comic, and absolutely honest insurance man whose job it is to ferret out suspicious claims; it is largely due to his performance, which gives the film a moral center, that we are able to buy into the otherwise off-beat performances that drive the action.<br/><br/>This was one of director Billy Wilder's first major hits, and he deserves considerable credit for making the weird elements of the story work as a whole, keeping the film smartly paced, and heaping it up with atmosphere. So influential that its impact would be difficult to over-estimate, DOUBLE INDEMNITY is a touchstone for the entire film noir genre. Recommended.<br/><br/>Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</div>\n",

The script, by Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler, is flawless. Wilder's direction is masterful. The cast is phenomenal, with Fred McMurray as a smart-talking but naive chump, Edward G. Robinson as a shrewd and relentless insurance investigator, and Barbara Stanwyck (her very best performance ever, IMO) as a scheming wife who wants her inconvenient husband out of the way.<br/><br/>The smartly-written dialogue still snaps and crackles and the suspense has lost none of its edge in the 70-plus years since the film was made. This is as fine a thriller as you'll ever see and a film that truly deserves being called a classic.</div>\n",

Never mind the fact that the script is formulaic and predictable, and the characters are all selfish and self-serving. Just sit back and enjoy some great acting and smart direction.<br/><br/>Billy Wilder knew exactly how far to stretch this tale of an insurance salesman who fatefully falls for the femme fatale who would spell ruin for him. He knew the strengths and weaknesses, and he let it ride from there.<br/><br/>Fred MacMurray gleefully overplays his stereotype hero guy. He's got the smarts, the looks and he's almost got the dame. As said beauty, Barbara Stanwyck is a must, and few could do this sort of thing better. Cap all this with the dry, witty performance from Edward G. Robinson who lives and breathes insurance claims. He gets all the best lines and devours them.<br/><br/>In a nutshell you have here a must for any 40's film buffs.<br/><br/>Sunday, November 1, 1998 - Astor Theatre</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Billy Wilder had directed some wonderful movies, Some Like it Hot, Sunset Boulevard, Sabrina, The Apartment and Witness for the Prosecution are all fantastic. Double Indemnity is up there with his very best. Wilder directs impeccably, but his direction is not the only great thing about Double Indemnity. Everything is great about it, it is a timeless classic and defines the term quintessential film noir.<br/><br/>The cinematography is gorgeous with no rough edges or shaky moments, instead it is all fluid and beautiful, and the costumes, sets and scenery also help. Also superb are Miklos Rozsa's wonderfully atmospheric score, the compelling story which sizzles with romance and sexual tension and the truly crackling screenplay.<br/><br/>The acting also is impressive. Fred MacMurray overplays slightly, but this is one of the cases when overplaying works, because he is still witty and charming as well. Barbara Stanwyck I think is sexy, her character appeals and her dialogue is so good as is her delivery of it, while Edward G.Robinson gives a superb supporting performance.<br/><br/>All in all, a stunning film and one of the very best of the genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox</div>\n",

Firstly the story itself, so wonderfully complex, loaded with twists and turns. Secondly the acting, so strong, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck are superb as the film's leads. I particularly love the way that Walter narrates the story, an original format, getting it from his point of view.<br/><br/>First time viewers are in for a treat, and will have zero idea of what the conclusion will be. Even now it looks so slick, excellent production values throughout, quite simply this film is exceptional. 10/10.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Greetings again from the darkness. \"I wonder if you wonder.\" Every time I hear Walter Neff say those words to Phyllis Dietrichson as their initial encounter concludes, I smile and settle in for another round of Double Indemnity (1944) ... one of my all-time favorites. Though I have seen it many times over the years, I recently saw it for the first time on the big screen ... and from a 35mm print! So much of the subtle filmmaking becomes apparent - the variance of lighting, the intensity of shadows, and the vividness of close-ups. This reinforces my belief that we should never miss an opportunity to view good films in a theatre setting ... just as the director intended.<br/><br/>Since this film was released 67 years ago, it's difficult to discuss without noting a key plot point or character reaction. If you haven't seen it and plan to, you might stop reading here. If you would like a little insight, then let's keep going. Billy Wilder (left) directed the film and his place as a Hollywood legend is quite secure. He was nominated for 21 Oscars (Director, Writer, Producer) and had 3 wins. Some of his classics are: The Lost Weekend, Sunset Blvd, Witness for the Prosecution, Some Like it Hot, The Apartment, The Front Page. Many think of Wilder as a comedic filmmaker and he certainly had success in that genre, but if you watch closely, even his comedies have a dark element to them.<br/><br/>Double Indemnity is based on the novella by James M Cain, who also wrote Mildred Pierce and The Postman Always Rings Twice. Wilder was a fan of Cain's book, but knew the dialogue wouldn't work well on screen. So together with Raymond Chandler they wrote a screenplay filled with crackling lines and a constant feeling of dread and pending doom. As great as the script is, it is heightened by a wonderful cast that includes Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G Robinson, Porter Hall, Jean Heather, Tom Powers, Richard Gaines and Byron Barr.<br/><br/>For me, MacMurray's performance is what brings the words to life and jumps the film to the \"must see\" category. He is playing against two Hollywood heavyweights in Stanwyck and Robinson, but we are somehow sympathetic to this not-so-bright guy who gets played like a fiddle by the villainous, wily woman he lusts after. Even as he is recording his confession, a part of us understands how he got drawn into MURDER! Not just any murder, but one for money and love ... only there is no money, and there is no love.<br/><br/>Ms. Stanwyck is perfectly cast as the femme fatale who weaves her web of deceit and destruction. She quickly spots the vulnerability of MacMurray's character and uses her assets just enough to hold the leash tight. It is a testament to her screen presence that she can pull off the sultry siren while sporting a less-than-desirable blonde wig. At the time, the wig was so controversial that the producers compared it to George Washington and wanted it trashed. However, filming was too far along and now it's impossible to imagine her looking any other way. Besides, MacMurray only seems to notice her anklet!<br/><br/>Edward G Robinson made a name for himself as a tough-guy actor ... cop and mobster all rolled into one. Here he plays the insurance investigator with a sixth-sense for fraudulent claims. He is a hard-nosed, dedicated employee who takes his responsibility very seriously and has no sympathy for those who cheat his cherished system. He has a soft spot for co-worker MacMurray, even though he is one of the back-slapping salesmen he so loathes. Their relationship in the film is one of respect and about as close as two professional men could be, given the era. When Robinson goes off on his rant about suicide research, he is a joy to behold. This guy could flat chew scenery.<br/><br/>In addition to the infamous wig, you might also notice that MacMurray is wearing a wedding band throughout the film, even though his character is clearly a single man. Wilder and MacMurray stated many times over the years that was simply a mistake and not \"caught\" until post-production. Expect a chuckle when MacMurray, as the narrator, enviously describes a Spanish style Los Angeles home as costing $30,000 ... probably less than the property taxes would be on that house today. The film originally was to end with MacMurray in the Gas Chamber and Robinson looking on (inset), but this was deemed inappropriate. One last little nugget: early in the film, MacMurray walks out of Robinson's office and past a man sitting on a hallway chair reading a paperback book. That man? Raymond Chandler, in his only on screen appearance.<br/><br/>The film is often described as quintessential Film Noir. Another prime example of Film Noir would be The Big Sleep (1946), based on a Raymond Chandler novel, directed by Howard Hawks, and starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. While Film Noir might not be an easily definable term, there are certain elements that must be present. Lighting is key. Shadows must be prevalent. Some type of detective story is usually at the center, and we typically get some poor schlub of a guy being yanked around by the femme fatale. The right \"mood\" is essential ... as a viewer we know things are headed down the wrong path, but we just can't save the characters from their own poor choices. But neither can we look away. That helpless feeling is a strong indicator that you just watched a terrific Film Noir.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Billy Wilder's cynical self came to public attention in this classic noir film about a luckless insurance salesman and one coldhearted dame. Double Indemnity skirted the very edges of Code morality and it took years before someone brought James M. Cain's novel to the screen.<br/><br/>According to a book on Billy Wilder the casting of Barbara Stanwyck was a must for Phyllis Dietrichson, otherwise the film might never have been made. Barbara Stanwyck was that rarest of players, one who could be good and convincing in all kinds of parts. Look at the films she got her four Oscar nominations besides Double Indemnity, Stella Dallas, Ball of Fire, and Sorry Wrong Number. Not one of those is similar to any one of the others and Stanwyck was acclaimed in all of them.<br/><br/>Fortunately for Wilder and for Paramount's budget, their leading man was right on the lot. Fred MacMurray who has been playing comedic foils for folks like Carole Lombard, Claudette Colbert, etc. up to that time, made the most of playing the feckless Walter Neff who gets sucked into a homicidal scheme through passion.<br/><br/>Double Indemnity is a landmark film in that it's two leads are really rotten people. Barbara Stanwyck has a husband in Tom Powers she can't stand and would like to bump him off for an insurance settlement and MacMurray's the insurance salesman she beguiles into her plot. Funny thing is that when the mechanics of the murder plot are discussed and formulated, the ideas are all MacMurray's. <br/><br/>Billy Wilder made two other films similar to Double Indemnity where a weak protagonist gets caught up in a filthy scheme. In Sunset Boulevard William Holden plays the gigolo way to well and can't break from unto pain of death. And Kirk Douglas's scheme about exploiting the tragedy of a man trapped in a cave brings him down all the way in Ace in the Hole. I'd be hard pressed to say which of the three men was worse.<br/><br/>The man who brings them down is Edward G. Robinson, the claims investigator in the insurance office where MacMurray works. Robinson is gradually putting the whole thing together and Wilder is at his best with the scenes of Robinson explaining the progress of his investigation to MacMurray with Fred trying to stay one step ahead.<br/><br/>Robinson doesn't usually get enough praise for Double Indemnity. He's got a little man, Hercule Poirot has those little grey cells. Either way both are up to the challenge of solving what looks like a perfect crime. Lot's of Agatha Christie's Belgian sleuth in James M. Cain's Barton Keyes.<br/><br/>Wilder for the one and only time in his career worked with another great mystery writer in Raymond Chandler on the script. It was not a pleasant experience for either. Chandler complained about the working conditions of Hollywood and Wilder complained about Chandler's dissipation. Both were probably right.<br/><br/>Among the supporting cast look for a nice performance by Porter Hall who turns out not to be as valuable witness as Robinson originally thought. The man from Medford may not lie, but he's not above a little chiseling.<br/><br/>Double Indemnity is one eternal classic it will be studied and dissected by film students for centuries.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">What many call the ultimate film noir, the murder mystery that is spoiled at the start, setting the stage for a retelling by our protagonist of the perfect crime, is unraveled before our eyes. Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity revolves around an insurance fraud murder that appears foolproof until the seams start to tear. Walter Neff, the top salesman two months in a row, falls in love with the young wife of an oilman, a woman looking for a way to leave her troubled marriage. Who better to get away with the perfect crime then a man that sees false claims avenged everyday? Their tracks must be covered and their guilt assuaged. However, being as our first scene shows Walter confessing to everything, we know the well-laid plans were unsuccessful. The trick to the film becomes how it all went down, how the puzzle pieces fell into place, and the power of a conscience, eating away at you until you can't stand the pressure any longer.<br/><br/>It is not giving away anything to say that the two complete the task of killing Mr. Dietrichson, a businessman with a temper. The deed is orchestrated to look like he fell off a train, a venue for accidental death that comes with a special double indemnity clause, one that pays twice the cost of his recently purchased insurance of $50,000. That money is the impetus that pushes Neff over the top to help his new mistress. Phyllis Dietrichson is the damsel in distress, the nurse of her husband's first wife that was naïve and heartbroken for her boss after his loss. She says it compelled her to stay with him in a union that never held any love. The chance arrival of Neff not only opens her eyes to the possibility of a clean break without any strings and actually some cash to boot, but also to a man she can spend time and possibly settle down with. It is a strange coincidence that the Dietrichson's auto insurance was allowed to lapse, creating a house call, and a happy accident that the man called to visit was one as immoral as Walter. Right from the start he flirts and makes advances towards the woman he knows is married to his client. It's not until the end that you start to consider whether none of it was by chance at all, but instead carefully planned out and manipulated from the first second.<br/><br/>Neff is played by Fred MacMurraya perfect fit for the role of a shady salesman, unafraid to get his hands dirty. The confidence and swagger allow us to believe he can win over the girl as easily as he does. He is the kind of guy that can fool the world into thinking he is on the level, a man of intelligence and pride. His boss, Barton Keyes and he have a very close relationship, one based on mutual respect and admiration. Neff has them all fooled into believing he is a man of character, one Keyes would personally vouch for, and his initial balk at the offer to help kill Dietrichson shows that maybe he is. Maybe there is some semblance of humanity behind the quick-witted banter and devious smile, a moral compass that won't allow him to cross the line. But greed and lust can tempt even a saint, let alone a guy like Neff, and it doesn't take long for him to begin the blueprints for what will be the perfect crime; one that not even Keyes and his keen lie detector can spot. It is that question of virtue that will ultimately undo him, though, as the strong stomach he thought he had might not be indestructible.<br/><br/>The story revolves around MacMurray and as a result he is on screen almost the entire time. He is our narrator and our entrance point into the proceedings. However, it is not a role that we necessarily relate to, nor even begin to feel sorry for to hope he gets away with the crime. Instead, knowing about his confession from the beginning, we sit down to watch his hubris shred his world to pieces. Each person is a cog to the tale at hand; it is the plotting of the film that takes center stage and top billing. The pieces are moved and we follow them through the twists and turns and revelations that change our preconceptions of each. No one is truly as they seem and they all have an ulterior motive just below the surface, propelling their actions and attempts for survival whether the other does or not. Our two criminals are selfish at heart, but until you watch the entire journey, you won't know just how much.<br/><br/>While the acting is definitely dated and a product of its time, it doesn't mean that it's not good. Barbara Stanwyck plays MacMurray's partner-in-crime Phyllis with equal panache. She holds her own in every situation, whether with her sharp tongue in some very funny back and forths or in her steely disposition when things get rough, it's a part that needs to be strong and is. Barton Keyes is the role that sticks with you, though. Edward G. Robinson is fantastic as the cocky claims agent, self-proclaimed as never being wrong when his gut says something isn't right. He delivers some of the best lines with such deadpan seriousness that you laugh even harder. The ego, cynicism, and attitude all add up to a man you have to respect, because under the tough exterior lies a man with heart. His dynamic with MacMurray is an interesting one, especially when seen through to the end. While they aren't completely fleshed out, each character is a detailed piece to the intricate web of deceit on display. Surrogates for the story to be shown to the audience, we watch them not for who they are, but for what they will do.</div>\n",

The actress playing the daughter looked too old for the role. Stanwyck was 37 when this was made and Mc Murray was 36.<br/><br/>I agree with the reviewer who stated Mc Murray's later roles in TV sit coms and so forth tainted his image. It's true it was hard to take him seriously.<br/><br/>A new Cadillac driving around the rail road tracks might attract some notice especially in 1939 (the year this is supposed to take place).<br/><br/>Also you have to suspend disbelief that Mc Murray would be so smitten by Stanwyck he would attempt anything like this. She is not especially at 37 (or any age!) the most attractive woman in the world. The blond wig? I guess was supposed to make her look ?? maybe cheap or tainted. She can carry any role though plouging through it like a bulldozer.<br/><br/>But these are so minor. I loved the movie watch it and read the other reviews.<br/><br/>RECOMMEND HIGHLY</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Walter Neff is an insurance salesman who meets the sultry Phyllis Dietrichson and falls madly in love with her. Together they hatch a scheme to forge a life insurance policy on Phyllis' husband and then bump him off. The plan seems perfect, but once the deed is done Walter's nerves start to fail him and a cunning fraud investigator at his office begins to dig a little too close to the truth ...<br/><br/>Billy Wilder's career was just a bit too acclaimed and strewn with accolades for me, but this classic adult film noir is deserving of all the praise it receives. The script, by Wilder and Raymond Chandler, is a dazzling adaptation of James M. Cain's pulp fiction classic. The murder sequence is both exhilarating in its detail and chilling in its realism - these are not gangsters or psychopaths, but ordinary people who do something monstrous borne out of lust and greed. Both MacMurray and Stanwyck (despite a silly blonde wig) give career-best performances which are charming, dazzling, amusing and chilling, all at the same time. Stanwyck is the ultimate cold-hearted femme-fatale (just pipping Lana Turner and Rita Hayworth in my opinion), and right from the moment she first appears (dressed only in a bath-towel), she eats up the screen. MacMurray is brilliant as Neff; a sap, but not a fool, who learns all too late he doesn't have what it takes to be a killer, and that women are never quite what they seem. Both are surpassed however by old pro Robinson as the wily claims investigator, who can smell a phoney setup a mile away. Robinson is amazing; a man for whom facts and statistics are never wrong and rule human nature, at least when it comes to money - a sad but profound truth. Equally good is the extremely dark photography by John Seitz (see also Sullivan's Travels, This Gun For Hire, Invaders From Mars and many others), with daring foreground shadows (Neff looking out his apartment window), stunning use of closeups (the big one of Phyllis while the dirty deed is being done) and many rule-breaking moments (when the husband is talking and signing the forms the focus should be on him, but it's on Phyllis). Best of all is Chandler's ricochet dialogue, which revs up the frisson and tumbles crookedly out of the actors. There are too many classy lines to mention, but my favourite is when Phyllis says, \"I wonder if I know what you mean.\", and Walter hits back with, \"I wonder if you wonder.\". Although movie adaptations of Dashiel Hammett's books kick-started this genre (The Thin Man, The Glass Key, The Maltese Falcon), this is the pivotal Hays-Code-ignoring lurid murder potboiler of the forties, followed by such greats as The Postman Always Rings Twice, Deadly Is The Female/Gun Crazy and D.O.A. (and later Blood Simple and Red Rock West). This is a stylish, extremely well acted movie of a great book, and a real treat for all fans of classic crime fiction.</div>\n",

Once you define who you are in the world of cinema, it determines a lot of what you think about what you have just experienced. <br/><br/>One of these roles is the type who by watching a film becomes part of its original audience, or rather a stylized nostalgic notion of what that audience was. Thus the film is a mere trigger, not necessarily important itself. There seem to be lots of these, people who consider this film as not only enjoyable, but the apogee of film noir, which itself is (in this view) the most movie-like of movies. Noir, romances and musicals attract these folks, as do legendary celebrities.<br/><br/>You may be one of these types, but I am not. I expect the film to transport me to its own world, not the world of original viewers. As a noir classic, it fails for me. I do think the dictaphone framing is very effective, and the thumblighting of the matches. Also of historical note is the then odd perspective on the detective form: at the beginning you know who did it. You soon learn why. How isn't very interesting. The way the detective gets the scent is purely conventional, but the focus on the hapless perpetrator was relatively novel in its time. The game is one of following this hapless goof through his ensnarement in forces beyond his control. His strong (and we learn misplaced) cockiness, apparent through the aggressive banter is the stylistic spice that is supposed to carry the notion.<br/><br/>But that device is pretty thin stuff. And except for the dictaphone bits, the dialog and acting are poor by conventional standards. Stanwyck isn't seductive or particularly deep. I fail to see how the lighting could be considered masterful, when so many other noir masters are around. `Touch of Evil' is excessive, but that's the point with noir -- at least noir that works today.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This film noir classic may be the best murder mystery of all time in this storied Hollywood genre. Fred MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson are excellent but it is Barbara Stanwyck who really makes the picture come together as a woman without a moral compass. Stanwyck set the standard for tough, calculating, shady women who exploit men without shame or remorse and her masterful manipulation of MacMurray is the movie's central theme. The film's imagery is filled with shadows and low lighting, accompanied by a tense, brooding music score. Stanwyck spins her web of ensnarement like a black widow with her victim seemingly unaware of the danger that enfolds him. MacMurray provides the narrative of the film which is told in flashback and delivers a cryptic account of the events in a confession to a boss who trusted him completely. Robinson is on target as the skeptical and suspicious boss who has a sixth sense about phony insurance claims. A nice supporting cast contributes to this thriller, namely Richard Gaines and Porter Hall.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Double Indemnity is based on a novel by James Cain adapted to the screen by great novelist Raymond Chandler, who made here his most important contribution to the cinema history in his career, though somehow matched by following screenwriting work for 1946 Howard Hawks' classic The Big Sleep, and Billy Wilder, who previously worked as a screen writer for Ernest Lubitsch and had been already nominated three times for Academy Awards in the process before making Double Indemnity, which nevertheless played the key role in establishing him as one of the best writer-directors in Hollywood, and giving him his fourth Oscar nomination as a writer and his first one as a director.<br/><br/>Double Indemnity was the third feature Wilder directed after 1942 The Major and the Minor and 1943 Five Graves to Cairo, but it was definitely the first film, his primary American tragedy where the author for the first time revealed his black and somehow hopelessly pessimistic view of the American society and of the human society in general, blackishly desecrated in the film simply by populating it with exceptionally sordid characters, who independently of being a victim or victimized, of being the protagonists or just simple supporters are never really able to transcend the utterly low and devilish motivations in theirs as a consequence sordidly painful lives and reach such a state where the viewer might get relieved by considering one of them as a positive element. Instead the characters' lives shown in a continuous noir flashback of Fred MacMurray's not-a-confession are driven from the start to the very end by an utter greed in a form of double and not only indemnities with consequential and inherent to it risks and fears in a rather unsure world of insurance.<br/><br/>An insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), a man with `no visible scars', starts to lose his already shaky dominance over his mind's yearnings when glimpses on a horizon a possibility of becoming a recipient of a monetary fortune along with no less seductive desire from a part of unhappily married and as devilishly beautiful as resourceful in pursuing her zany in its deadliness schemes, an ultimate femme fatale blond Phyllis (marvellously portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck).<br/><br/>Initially apparent as a romantic, the relationship gradually mutates into double confrontation of the two fears of the two characters in their greedy and ambitious pursuits, a conflict which at one point apparently results in a sort of humanization of Phyllis' character, appearing hiding the eyes of her soul behind the sun glasses, a humanization which is let to happen by her only to accentuate later her unchangeably fatal nature.<br/><br/>The double confrontation gradually evolves into a triple one when the threatening presence on the scene of no less and probably more resourceful character of Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) becomes more and more evident, as a result of his continuous and obsessive investigation conducted with different but nor less ambitious motives. A motives which find its ultimate revelation in a most touching, but finally most hypocritical scene of declaration of love (I love you - I love you too) between Walter Neff and Barton Keyes in the end, exactly reflecting the same nature of previous interactions between Walter and Phyllis, where such moments with the very words used, such as the supreme word of loving affection - Baby lowered to an unthinkable extent, only were a mere preparation to struck another blow in yet another outburst of hate caused by a new misfortunate complication in carrying out so well devised and apparently perfect plan.<br/><br/>\n",
            "Permeated right from the start to the very end with the flavour of unstoppable fatality in an extent that a few other film-noirs achieved, accentuated by the wonderful music score by Miklos Rozsa, Double Indemnity's story is motored by the money like in nearly all of Billy Wilder films. But in this case all the misery produced by it as evident as never before resulting in utter corruption of already corrupted characters and their descent into a such a deep abyss of human misery as probably never before or after in a Hollywood film history, an abyss with no exit, with omnipresent hypocrisy, with no place for sincere human feelings of love, friendship or affection, an abyss to where the characters descent under the monotonous tune of Miklos Rozsa's score, which serves as a reflection of their monotonously hypocrite and ultimately doubly doomed lives. 10/10</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Double Indemnity is considered by many to be the first movie in the noir genre, a category of films that often feature female characters who are likely to endanger the lives of men they get into relationships with. I don't really think it's true that this is the absolute first noir ever made, since Two Seconds starring Edward G Robinson was released back in the 30s and featured many of the things we associate with noir today. That's not to say Double Indemnity is unoriginal. It definitely has enough of an interesting and dangerous storyline to hold the viewer's attention constantly. The movie stars Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, and Edward Robinson in a smaller role. Even when he's not featured as prominently as the other actors, he manages to be one of the most enjoyable parts of the movie. The story is told as a flashback, which means it returns to where it started by the time the film is over. Walter Neff (MacMurray), is a man in the insurance business, and is trying to sell car insurance to people by walking into their houses and making a pitch. One day, he comes across Mr. Dietrichson and his wife, Phyllis (Stanwyck). Everything appears to go well, until sometime later when Phyllis makes some comments regarding her husband's life insurance without him knowing. This convinces Walter that she is trying to murder him, but not just that. Walter eventually becomes involved and comes up with a scheme that will invoke a \"double indemnity\" clause, which states the life insurance company will cough up more money to Barbara as compensation for Mr. Dietrichson's death. The problem is, both her and Walter have to make it look like an accident or it won't be worth it. Later on, Walter hides in the back of Phyllis' car when she is driving her husband someplace, and he kills him. Walter then pretends to be Mr. Dietrichson by using crutches to board a train and then jump off when nobody is looking, making it look like a suicide. The spot he jumps off at has Barbara waiting for him, and they promptly drag Mr. Dietrichson's real body into place. Despite the scheme just being carried out very recently, it's already causing commotion at Walter's workplace. His boss believes Dietrichson killed himself, but Keyes (Robinson) is not so sure. He ultimately comes to the conclusion that Phyllis is at least partially guilty of something, and his reasoning for this is the fact she has been seeing another man behind her husband's back. Keyes can't prove this, but it would make his whole theory come together. Meanwhile, Lola (Mr. Dietrichson's daughter) is understandably distraught by the loss of her father and starts to become a thorn in Walter's side as well. She tells him how her mother died in the care of a negligent nurse who actually turned out to be Phyllis. Because of this, she is absolutely convinced Phyllis had a hand in killing her father. With both Lola and Keyes searching left and right for clues about Phyllis being a murderer, Walter decides it's time to lay low and cuts off communications with her for a while. He's not even allowed to call her since Keyes may have sabotaged the phones. Things get worse for Walter when Keyes calls him to his office one day to meet the same exact person who saw him jump off the train the night he pretended to commit suicide, although the witness doesn't recognize him. Once cleared of suspicion, Walter goes to Phyllis' house to tell her they are through. He also says he knows she is seeing another man behind his back. Phyllis shoots him, but Walter survives and feigns attraction toward her, allowing him to shoot her as they hug each other. Back at his office, Walter starts talking into a dictaphone (which is how the movie begins), and Keyes shows up to call the police on him. This is a great movie. The plot is not very complex once you realize it's essentially about Phyllis trying to get money from the death of her husband, but there's so many twists throughout that it seems complicated. Unexpected turns in the story are one of the things that define noir movies, and there's a lot of that on offer here. The great music composed by the Hungarian Miklos Rozsa is one of the best aspects of this film, since it is very dramatic and fitting for the constant conspiring Double Indemnity has. The dialogue is smartly written and the cast of characters are memorable, mainly since there are not many of them. Fred MacMurray plays Walter very well, accurately depicting his frustration (and excitement) as he is drawn deeper and deeper into an illegal scheme with his female acquaintance. Barbara Stanwyck as Phyllis acts as both a friend and later a rival to Walter, the latter becoming more visible as the film goes on. At first, she looks up to him as a beacon of hope who is capable of liberating her from her bleak life with an abusive husband. Later on, Walter claims his boss knows too much about their scheme and must abandon it, making her incandescent with rage. You can't forget Robinson either. Even though he's a lesser character in this movie, he appears consistently throughout many of its scenes. He's the one that takes the initiative when it comes to proving Phyllis caused the death of her husband to collect insurance money. Perfect writing, great characters, an interesting story, fitting and dramatic music, and all released to audiences before noir was really a genre. There are many reasons why Double Indemnity can be called one of the best noirs ever made, but these are the ones I chose.</div>\n",

The screenplay itself is a work of art in its charater construction, plot structure and dialogue which is delievered by an ensemble of first class actors divying up first class performances. Barbra Stanwyck as the deadly, smouldering, scheming Phyllis Dietrichson turns in a performance that is right up there with Mary Astor's Brigid O'Shaughnessy. Fred McMurray delievers a performance of a smart but desperately lovelorn patsy and Edward G. Robinson is perfect in the role of Barton Keyes and just about steals the moment every time he appears on screen.<br/><br/>I personally love a good Noir film and this is right up there with the best of them. Billy Wilder should be proud of this work eventhough the Academy didn't see it fit to reward him for his efforts, however I personally think this film is an absolute winner.</div>\n",

The visuals were admittedly cool and the overall aesthetic of the movie was well done, but what was the point? It ultimately just amounted to being a very pretentious, try hard, extreme film for commercial audiences. I felt like it tried very hard to be thought provoking when it was really just leaving out details and not really finishing anything it started with. On top of that, the ending scenes with Mia Goth freaking out were very hard to take seriously. I wasn't sure if the director meant for it to be comedic or not.<br/><br/>D+</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I saw \"Infinity Pool\" last night in the theatre. It is a very strange movie directed by Brandon Cronenberg, the son of David Cronenberg (\"Videodrome\", \"The Fly\", etc.) It is about a couple (Alexander Skarsgård and Cleopatra Coleman) who travel to a luxury resort in a repressive dictatorship. They meet another couple (Jalil Lespert and Mia Goth) who convince them to travel off the grounds of the resort, even though it is prohibited by the rules of the resort and country. Soon a tragedy occurs, and the couple is thrust into a fever dream of drugs, sex and violence. Mia Goth is excellent as the temptress who pushes Skarsgård's character into doing things he would never think of doing. Skarsgård is wasted in this role and his character takes actions that defy common sense. And while some have praised Brandon Cronenberg's direction - I found some of the strange angles and quirks he uses to be more annoying than ingenious. There is a surfeit of sex, violence and gore for those who enjoy that, but I cannot say that it really added anything to a convoluted plot that really makes no sense. Only recommended for Mia Goth's standout performance - wait for cable or Netflix on this one. 5/10.</div>\n",

I honestly have no idea why people like this film. I could barely get through it and honestly couldn't wait for it end. I normally like Mia Goth films but this one didn't do it for me. She was super cringe in this. Especially in the scene where she's riding on the front of the car. Her screeching voice almost made my head explode. How this film has a rating above six stars is beyond me. This is definitely not a film I'd recommend or torture myself by sitting through again. 4 stars.</div>\n",

On their way home from a day of picnicking James hits and kills a local farmer with the car. He is arrested and sentenced to be executed by the farmer's son. However, there is a way out of this predicament.<br/><br/>Reading the plot summaries of this it seemed like it was going to be a pretentious arthouse film. When I discovered that it is written and directed by Brandon Cronenberg, son of David Cronenberg, I was convinced that this would be a weird-for-weirdness-sake arthouse flick.<br/><br/>To my surprise, however, the film starts quite interestingly and engagingly and develops quite well. There are some artsy scenes, largely drugged out dream sequences, so we aren't spared that but for the most part the first 60-70% of the film is quite good.<br/><br/>The clone idea, its uses and abuses and its effect on James Foster was fascinating and I figured this would be the thrust of the remainder of the film. I was running over in my mind where the film could go from there and most of the possibilities were quite exciting.<br/><br/>However, instead of going down one of these paths Cronenberg chooses a lesser one, one that lives up to the expectation I had at the beginning of pretentious mindscrewery. Quite disappointing as the film seemed set up for a powerful, thrilling climax.</div>\n",

He gets cloned because he killed someone and the original person gets to die then the clone did another crime so that clone dies and another one cloned.

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This film had the potential to be something new and creative in the horror genre, but wirter/director Brandon Cronenberg settles for more of the same of his usual style with little in the way of an understanding of why these events are occuring or even caring that they are happening. Now, I am a fan of his. Antiviral and Possessor are fantastic films that benefit from his particular brand of trippy visuals and existential analysis. The difference between those films and his latest effort is he does little to help build tension and does nothing to make us care for any of the characters he has written. They are all terrible people, not one of them worth redemption.<br/><br/>All the acting is very well done, Mia Goth is always a sure bet when playing a sinister crazy person. Alexander Skarsgård, unfortunately, isn't given enough material here to truly shine in his role. He's a practically one dimensional shell of a character, and that is one of the main reasons the film did not work for me. I felt nothing for his character, and the character makes some of the worst decisions I've seen on film. Barely any of the film makes sense if I'm being honest. Best not to ask why to any of the questions you have because, more than likely, they will not be answered. Seriously, the movie will bring up a point and then completely ditch it the next minute. It was a frustrating watching experience.<br/><br/>I would like to see the NC-17 director's cut just to see how much of the depravity was actually cut out of the film as I felt this one was rather tame, minus a heated and trippy orgy segment that was pretty graphic for an R rated film. But violence wise, I felt the film didn't go far enough and what was shown was just too strange and disconnected for it to have any impact.<br/><br/>Then we come to the ending. Wtf was that? He just decides to stay? Why? Everybody left! There was nothing left to do, why would he not go home himself? Also, he didn't even try to get even with the people who just destroyed his entire life for their amusement? Then what was the purpose of any of this story? It didn't really have one from what I could tell. Disappointing.<br/><br/>Overall, I only recommend it when it's free on a streaming service. Otherwise, I would say don't bother. Only reason I'm not giving it a 0 is because it was well made. The trippy cinematography was on point, but that was about it.<br/><br/>1.5 cults out of 5.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I walked into this movie knowing little to nothing other than Brandon Cronenberg was at the helm, and Mia Goth was staring. I heard it was artsy, and \"disturbing\" but that should've meant it was right up my alley. What I found out was that, while the film's acting + visuals + base story concept were good....it just felt a little underwhelming.<br/><br/>Let's start with what was good. Like I said, the acting is pretty good from the two main leads. Mia Goth goes over the top, and Alexander Skarsgard goes more realistic and human, which is a good contrast. Visuals are pretty good, same with the sound. The story has a premise that will get you interested in the first 30 minutes, dealing with a rich resort and a local government that loves to clone. However, this is where it has problems.<br/><br/>The story and characters are its biggest problem. They're not bad per se, but they are not are par with the rest of the film. I feel like the cronenbergs always have great ideas, but cannot execute on the characters and fleshing out of the story. You don't relate to the main character \"James\" all that much. I can sympathise with him, and I kinda liked him but it just wasn't enough. Same with Mia Goth, you never see why the way she is other than maybe inferences (stuff that would spoil the movie). It just needed a special something in the story department to top it off, but we don't get that.<br/><br/>If you like these types of experimental and artsy movies, then I would recommend giving it a shot (you love it). However, if you're more of a casual movie goer, you can probably skip. Unless you wanna pop a couple edibles and have a very weird night. However, Avatar or Puss in Boots would probably give you a better experience in that department.</div>\n",

Briefly, a couple on vacation in some exotic and dangerous place find themselves in trouble right off the bat. Things go down hill fast, especially with a husband as stupid as this guy. There is a great deal of so called psychedelic gobbly gook, which takes up a lot of screen time and requires zero acting. I kept wondering if this skarsgard is the same one i have liked so often. Maybe he's one of the duplicates from the film. If this is art, we are in for a very long year. I heard that this was a terrifying experience. Laughable, would be a better description, .

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Infinity Pool, the latest from writer/director Brandon Cronenberg, focuses on James and Em Foster, on vacation to help James clear his head in order to attempt writing his second novel. James and Em meet and are guided by a mysterious couple also vacationing outside of the resort to find themselves stuck in a culture packed with sex, violence, and unimaginable terrors. After a fatal vehicular accident leaves them facing the wrath of local law enforcement, James and Em are faced with a decision: be executed for their crime or, if rich enough, watch themselves die. What results is a downward plunge into debauchery, murder, and desperation.<br/><br/>Infinity Pool stars Alexander Skarsgård and Mia Goth. Fresh off his tilt as Amleth in 2022's The Northman, Skarsgård plays a very different character here. In Infinity Pool Skarsgård is James Foster, struggling writer married to Em Foster, daughter of a power publisher and the couple's breadwinner. An amenable guy, James is enjoying his vacation with Em at Lotoka, a beachside country. Skarsgård plays James with the air of a man a bit adrift in life, clinging onto Em as a comfortable life raft. As an actor used to playing characters with power (see: True Blood) or iron determination (Mute, The Northman), Skarsgård takes a surprising turn as a meek, easily-lead man. While the change of pace is refreshing, Skarsgård's portrayal of James is nothing noteworthy. His passable acting is enough to offset the insanity that is Mia Goth.<br/><br/>Mia Goth as Gabi Bauer is trouble from the first moment she appears on screen until her final. A performance that starts unsettling before ramping up to completely unhinged, Goth milks every ounce of craziness she can from the script. While it's not always for the best (Goth has some truly questionable line readings in this), she's by far the overall best part of the movie. While her characterization is maddening, the motivations Cronenberg gives Gabi are nebulous at best. Thankfully, that's no fault of Goth's and when she shows up on screen, audiences are in for a treat.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Brandon Cronenberg, Infinity Pool is the director's second outing after 2020's amazing debut, Possessor. Sadly, the sophomore slump is apparent in his second project, giving audience and body horror fans a lackluster followup that's unfocused and meandering. From a directing standpoint, Cronenberg is still sharp, delivering tension and suspense along with the cringe-inducing scenes the family is known for. Extreme closeups of mutilation, murder, and blood by the buckets (topped off with a cumshot in the film's first 30 minutes) will put moviegoers on their backfoot while being completely vulnerable to whatever could happen next. Cinematographer Karim Hussain, who also shot the beautiful Possessor, delivers on the goods again, providing a remarkable visual journey that James embarks upon. Cronenberg's choice to shoot Infinity Pool in Croatia, one of the planet's most beautiful countries, while mostly resisting the opportunity to display that beauty and instead focus on the grime and side streets is a commendable decision that lines up with tone of the movie.<br/><br/>As a writer, after tackling the theme of identity loss in an increasingly technological world in Possessor, in Infinity Pool no such messages seem to exist outside of a general human desensitivity to death. The first act might be the story's strongest, developing characters and creating situations that will entice the audience to be locked in and attentive. Unfortunately in the second act turn, where everything starts to fall apart for James, is also where everything will fall apart for the audience. James' descent into depravity, while interesting to look at in a well executed montage of sex and psychedelics, ultimately leads to a chaotic story with little in the way of explanation or true resolution.<br/><br/>Overall, Infinity Pool is a mess of a movie. Within that mess are hints at something good, possibly great, but Cronenberg seems to be too in love with the idea of creating something off kilter more than telling an actual story. Alexander Skarsgård's performance is passable as a man lost in hedonism, while Mia Goth's unhinged insanity somehow fluctuates between amazing and downright lousy. Lacking the usual amount of body horror audiences have come to expect from the name Cronenberg, this film instead chooses to skate by on its ambience, which doesn't always work in its favor.</div>\n",

The imagery belongs in hell! This film is something very odd, trippy, filled with madness, and not for everyone. The Cronenberg's have a common horror weirdness they are fairly brilliant. To me the movie gets praise because it's art despite being ghoulish and bonkers there's a lot to enjoy like the writing is incredible, flow of the story is great, and highly entertaining throughout I especially love the masks used in several scenes. I recommend and hope anyone appreciates my opinions.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Infinity Pool is another derivative, cliché-ridden attempt at a dime-a-dozen satire of immoral wealthy people, complete with all the pretentious, amateurish filmmaking tropes - flashing lights and chaotic editing for cheap \"psychedelic\" effect, ample yet unconvincing gore for cheap shock value, tasteless pornography to seem self-serious (and for more shock value), and awful, dreadful, eye-rollingly poor overacting from most of the cast (especially from Mia Goth; her performance is laughable in its desperation). All in all, this is a very poor (and let's just say it: likely nepotism-fueled) attempt at an emulation of Cronenberg Sr., and it falls flat on its face at every turn. Every big twist in the story can be seen from a mile away by anyone with a brain who has seen a horror/sci-fi film before - and I do mean *every* twist. It almost reaches undergrad film school-level of predictable, although I won't be quite that harsh. It is, nevertheless, pretty damn bad.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">From 'gosh it looks like a Cronenberg movie' to 'gosh it is his son's movie' is one step. Unfortunately a pretty long step. Indeed, it is in the combination of the very strong influence of his father's filmography with the attempt to break away from it that Infinity Pool finds its undoing. The film lacks so much structure, cohesion, and meaning that it is difficult to give it a well-structured review.<br/><br/>Starting with the premise, the film immediately fails to get the viewer oriented in the world it wants to tell about: are we in our reality? In an alternative one? Li Tolqa's costumes are unusual, but outside of it, is our morality that of the protagonists? The film would lean toward making us understand that Li Tolqa is a fictitious place, yet immersed in our reality. With the main characters we should consequently share morals. If this is indeed the case, the fictional reality of the film cannot stand on itself in the slightest, as it is too improbable. If, on the other hand, this is not the case, the film fails miserably in making us understand what key we should give to what we see depicted on the screen. This makes it, yes disturbing, but overall alienating to the viewer of the story. The result is too full, too confusing, too eager to provoke and disturb to have a defined identity. The use of continuous technical virtuosity also contributes to the sensation of overall overabundance of the story.<br/><br/>This is not to say that there were not many elements of potential interest, or that the director lacks skill and talent, but how the entire production fell short in reducing, deducting, and correcting all those elements that separate an experimental film from a messy one.</div>\n",

As you have wealth, you can settle and walk free, an odd procedure and some strange hyperbole, but a boundary's been stepped over, no longer fixed in an enclosure, plus there's a catalyst, to incite, who's full of glee.<br/><br/>Mia Goth, as the seductive Gabi Bauer, alongside her hedonistic friends, introduce the somewhat innocent James Foster, more than ably performed by Alexander Skarsgård, to their limitless world of excess, a world that doesn't quite reward him quite as well as it does his newly found playmates.<br/><br/>Great performances, kaleidoscopic cinematography, original in its interpretation, worth a watch, but you may well wish you hadn't, a bit like James.</div>\n",

I think this was due in part to their heavy accents or just them talking pretty low. Eventually I was able to understand what was going on and thought it would get interesting.<br/><br/>It was actually the opposite. The violence and the gore was tolerable. The nudity was excessive with one scene being too drawn out. It could have been toned down without affecting the story. Mia Goth does a great job playing crazy but I felt she could have been used in a more brutal way. Her character was used in a more seductive and manipulative way. She did a great job doing both of those things, I just wanted more especially with the concept of this film.<br/><br/>I didn't care too much for Alexander Skarsgard's character. He did fall into this game that was being played but the morality of it all was never really questioned. His character should have captured the emotional affects of what was going on in a more dramatic fashion. The only time he showed any kind of emotion was when he was afraid of seeing himself being used for entertainment.<br/><br/>Cleopatra Coleman who played Skarsgard's wife was basically a wasted character who could have easily been eliminated from the story entirely.<br/><br/>The plot of this story basically went nowhere. It was just event after event that gave the audience hope for a great reveal or twist but in the end didn't do either. The movie could have been more entertaining considering the amount of violence it had. It felt like it dragged at times. Just one of those films with a great idea, but wasn't executed to its fullest potential.<br/><br/>I give it 3 stars for Mia Goth, movie concept and some of the visual elements.</div>\n",

Additionally the acting was just plain bad, but having seen Alexander Skarsgard in other things, I'll blame the director for that too. And the female antagonist was just soooooo annoying that I found it hard to believe the main character would go along with anything she wanted.

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Infinity Pool can't decide it's theme or what it wants to be. Reviewers speak to its satire and atmospheric horror, but the film struggles to deliver a visual or narrative approach befitting of either genre. It's caught between being an art house film project, a vacation horror, and a cultural mirror/satire.<br/><br/>A major problem with IP is that it's gratuitous without value. This wouldn't be a problem if the movie was comfortably a horror, but it's not. It's a bit more pretentious and strives to overcome a shallow plot by throwing a nauseating (and overdone) drug trip montage and senseless sexuality at the viewer.<br/><br/>Other issues include the main character's \"arc\", or confusion thereof. The plot had fertile ground to explore what it's like to watch yourself die, but the pacing jumps the gun. The switch from horror to amusement is fast, only to be contradicted when they attempt a moral redemption when he discovers the person he's beating isn't who he thinks it is. This non-adherance to theme development seriously detracts from IP's quality. And that goes without saying the final act is so horrifically bad and needless I was inclined to walk out.<br/><br/>The Prestige does a much better job addressing the psychological horror of having a double/clone, and Midsommar does a much better job of being cultural satire, and atmospheric horror. At least the latter has a rhyme and reason for it's graphic gore and nudity, given its setting.<br/><br/>This one is entirely passable.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This film is another example of trying to follow in your dad's footsteps, and tripping. It takes some really good shrooms to come up with such eye-candy visuals, with a story that is absolute nonsense and defies all logic or reasoning. Don't get me wrong, the premise was brilliant, but the story that follows is nonsense. If you can, image what creative vomit would look like, there's your film. Had any small amount of rhyme or reason been thrown in, this may have been watchable.<br/><br/>You're supposed to get better as a filmmaker the more films you make, yet here we have a film titled Infinity Pool, with zero logic to why that title was even selected - except for it mentioned in one irrelevant sentence throughout the film. At least say the word Cloning, and show it happens in an infinity pool-like laboratory, not some emptied out barn or closed down YMCA shower stall. I guess the shrooms wore off when it came time to select a title.<br/><br/>Writer and director Brandon Cronenberg showed promise with his previous film Possessor 2020, as it at least had some sort of cohesive story to it, albeit convoluted and ridiculous, but at least it was a fair one-time watch I couldn't say was a waste of time. But this mess, it creates a big build up, with no reward at the end. The first act is a great set-up, but then the final two acts felt like bad SNL sketches, with a few scenes where the camera falls into multicolored paint buckets. It was all style and no substance, with a meaningless, shallow, and eye-roll inducing plot, that was even more convoluted and incoherent than his previous film. Think of it as getting dressed up to go to the ball, but ending up at a bunch of annoying drunkfest frat parties instead.<br/><br/>It's a disappointing yet very generous 5/10 from me, all going towards a decent score, the cinematography, and Goth's performance.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"Infinity Pool\" follows James Foster, a struggling writer vacationing with his wife Em at a posh resort in a fictional third-world country. There, he meets Gabi and her husband, Alban. When an illicit trip outside the resort's gates leads to a tragic accident, James is faced with execution; or, as an alternative, the execution of a \"double\", a clone of himself, whose sacrifice he must bear witness to. What ensues is a rapid psychological downslide into vengeance, self-abasement, and debauchery.<br/><br/>This twisted and imaginative effort from Brandon Cronenberg is sure to divide audiences, though it is not necessarily as overtly arthouse-y as one might expect. The plot setup here is quite familiar, at least at first: Fears and dangers of a third-world criminal justice system loom over the first act, replete with Stalinist prison settings and officers who look like they were pulled straight from the SS. A nervy score and dizzying cinematography plummet the audience toward an \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\"-esque scenario that warps into something far beyond the familiar trappings of a frivolous slasher movie.<br/><br/>There are voluminous thematic layers here to be unpeeled, and the film descends into a nightmarish scenario in which the protagonist finds himself at the hands of a cultish horde of self-proclaimed \"zombies\", others who have gone through the same \"doubling\" as a means of atonement for their crimes. The film forces its audience to contemplate shuddering notions in which one must kill off pieces of themselves, both figuratively and literally, and a masochistic pleasure in doing so emerges amongst Cronenberg's acid-trip visuals. Layered in, perhaps more interestingly, is a pronounced subtext that explores the relationship between the wealthy vacationers and the country's strange justice system, whose loophole offers them quasi-limitless possibilities to engage in crime and debauchery--but at what real cost?<br/><br/>Alexander Skarsgard gives a solid performance here as the downtrodden writer who is doing some \"soul-searching\" for his belabored second work, while Mia Goth has her hand at what is essentially a classic femme fatale role, delivering an utterly deranged version of the archetype. Cleopatra Coleman stands counterpoint as James's heiress wife, who, unlike him, is deterred by the proverbial flame that he is drawn to like a moth.<br/><br/>Overall, \"Infinity Pool\" is a nervy and frightening descent through a \"nine circles of hell\" scenario, shot through with a near-debilitating dose of speculative and science fiction. It is a film that taunts you as much as it makes you think, both to discomforting lengths. If one thing is for certain, an artistic representation of the writer's search for \"inspiration\" has never looked (or felt) so harrowing. 9/10.</div>\n",

I did enjoy the first quarter, but wanted to leave at the half mark. The wife is annoying and the other woman is just beyond terrible. I don't understand why someone thought this was a good idea? It reminded me of the stupid movies made in the 60s for some reason. I just want to warn people that have issues with crazy drug induced violence and sex scenes then this movie isn't for you.

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Plenty of hype and intrigue has paved the way for Brandon Cronenberg's new horror feature - \"Infinity Pool\", and I too, especially after 2020's \"Possessor\" (8/10), expected a lot. Good news is that Cronenberg family horror brand is definitely kickin', alive and well for already the 5th decade, but the bad news is that the sum of it all fell a bit below my expectations, just like Daddy Cronenberg's last year's return to horror with \"Crimes of the Future\".<br/><br/>James and Em Foster are enjoying a sunny vacation on the beaches of the fictional island of La Tolqa. The resort is separated from the rest of the country by fences and barbwire, and together with their newly made friends, the couple will venture out and find the island's terrible system of laws, perverse subcultures and surreal happenings.<br/><br/>Led by an absolutely terrific cast with some awesome highlights from Mia Goth and Alexander Skarsgard, \"Infinity Pool\" serves up all the best traditions of a Cronenberg horror movie, including neo-futuristic ideas wrapped in old-school aesthetics, practical effects, psychedelic sequences, beautiful cinematography and editing, and a grim atmosphere. Sounds great, but as the runtime goes, the movie seems to explore less and less of the intriguing concepts introduced. \"Infinity Pool\" doesn't build up many scares, much of suspense or creepiness, but instead seems to opt for shock, disgust and moral perversion. The ground on which the film is built on is fruitful, with lots of potential, but the exploration after comes as... underwhelming and underwritten. Although I enjoyed it all the way through, in the end I couldn't shake the feeling that it could've been thematically more potent, like Brandon could've squeezed more juice out of these ideas of his.<br/><br/>The world of \"infinity Pool\" is about minimizing the border between action and consequences, stepping over boundaries that can't be built back up. The characters get desynthesized against the vile nature of humanity, and the film itself, too, although visceral and called \"disturbing\" by many, feels a tad bit ineffective in a similar way as violence does for the characters involved.<br/><br/>A beast with qualities like these is usually right up my alley, but \"Infinity Pool\", although leaving my eyes entertained, some pictures ingrained in memory, and a great appreciation for the performances inside my heart, also left my brain feeling like the action stopped before letting the climax happen. My rating: 7/10.</div>\n",

I cannot see why anyone would give this more than 2 stars, it is such a pile of trash. I do appreciate them inventing a fictitious country, complete with it's own alphabet, yet everyone speaks perfect English, that makes sense, right? And this poor backwards country has the ability to make perfect clones of people in minutes over and over? And the purpose of this is to kill the clones for the original person's crime and charge that person a bunch of money? What? Wouldn't it make more sense just to charge them a huge fine in the first place? And there are a few couples who come back to the resort every year to repeat this idiocy? Don't even try to make sense out of this thing; there is sex, then gory violence, then sex, then some trippy video, then more gore, just random whatever.

Aside from an interminable psychedelic orgy scene that just wouldn't end, the movie didn't take the violence and depravity far enough. Anyway, bursting at the seams with supposed depth doesn't do away with the need to make an entertaining product. I was happy when the movie ended.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Paint It Yellow. Oops.that's suppose to be Rang De Basanti.. Well that's exactly the director tries to convey. Its about today, us and our present, yet the similarities we have from the Pre-independence era. The Gen-x who knows Mac-D but still prefers the Dhaba Paranthas with sweet Lassi. However they restrict their national values only to food and nothing more. Its not a run of the mill stuff with 6 six romantic songs, couple of foreign locales and then finally some emotional drama.. No no no.. Rang Deis a Cult movie. It is more of an introspection, a food for our thought process. It makes us think, as to how should we actually celebrate our freedom. I was really moved by some of the ending lines by the narrator, \"I thought there are 2 types of people in the world, one who die crying and other who move away in silence but today I learned there is third genre, people who go laughing\". That says it all <br/><br/>Rang De is definitely a very brave and innovative attempt by the director and for that matter he has selected a near perfect cast. However veterans like Om Puri and Anupam Kher looked disposed. All the characters grow gradually in the film and make you think their way. Everyone is given enough space to justify their talent. Rakesh Omprakash Mehra is a director of the new emerging Indian cinema, he always tries to bring in something very different. I was really impressed by his last attempt in 2001 for Aks (Amitabh Bachchan and Manoj Bajpai ), and he definitely has succeeded in making another fabulous master piece. The highlight of the movie is the great use of cinematography techniques. Its probably for the first time in Indian cinema that juxtaposing has been used with such a great effect. The way each character gradually immerses into scenes from the past leaves you fantasizing about the hard work that has gone in the background to create this, both technically and on the part of the actor.<br/><br/>The movie starts on a very high spirit reflecting today's youth mindset who believe that patriotism is something that looks good in history chapters and today's world is far ahead of all that, they would prefer to go boozing and dancing rather than thinking on any of those lines. The way the campus scenes are shown really makes everyone go down the memory lanes of beautiful college days. This is followed by some intriguing drama and events which turns the life of a group of buddies upside-down altogether.<br/><br/>The film grows on you gradually. The director has made sure that there is a clear message in everything he presents, even the group of boys represents different sects of society and religion. Hence creating an appeal for everyone watching it. Music is another high point of the show, its foot tapping and very much with the mood of the subject. The songs give you a sense of freedom from within, a freedom to think in one's own way. A.R. Rehman doesn't need any introductions and he is surely one of the most original music directors we have in the country.<br/><br/>The brilliance of Aamir Khan is something very difficult to narrate, he has proved it umpteen number of times that he is truly the most versatile actor in the industry. His comic timing in the first part is better than anything seen in recent past. He is extremely fluent even with difficult Punjabi tongue twisters and the acting prowess he has shown would be very difficult to match by anyone around. He appears so natural and his complete look with new hairstyle (which is now part of his every new movie) gives a very striking combination.<br/><br/>Well the most wanting part of the whole thing has been the script to certain extent, it appears very loose in the second half and at times gives a droning feel. Few new ideas presented by the author looked half-baked. However it has been the technical expertise of the director who managed to save the things with some outstanding camera work and editing.<br/><br/>Rang De  is for sure a must watch movie, it doesn't have any preaching but still it will force you to think once. As they say it \"There are two primary choices in life, to accept conditions as they exist or take upon the responsibility to change them\". I believe most of us want to bring about the changes without doing anything, so its time to think again folks and take some responsibility, lets Paint It Yellow</div>\n",

We make trivia now that neither entertain nor enlighten.To put it very bluntly, we make utter trash.Good work in the world is being done elsewhere, especially in India where a Bhansali stretches the limits of cinematic expression, where a new Wilder emerges in the shape of Anees Bazmee, where Shaad Ali springs a surprise with a Bunty Aur Bubbly,where out of nowhere comes a Guru Dutt in the garb of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and takes us to a new level of awareness and self-discovery through cinema in a stunning masterpiece called Rang De Basanti.<br/><br/>I challenge anyone to name a film made anywhere in the last fifteen years or so to hold a candle to this one.It is simply awesome.As an entertainer it is superb, as purposeful film it goes even further.As a fearless, bold crusader for just causes it is beyond compare.The whole team deserves to be congratulated.<br/><br/>Apart from the tremendous contribution made by the writers and the director of the movie, the people who need to be singled out and applauded for the high quality of their work are Aamir Khan(his best role yet),Soha Ali Khan(who finally claims our attention with this role and is destined to be as distinguished as her mother Sharmila Tagore). Waheeda Rehman makes you feel that Guru Dutt is back directing her from heaven.Kirron Kher who is improving with every picture.And all the boys from Kunal Kapoor to Atul Kulkarni.All have turned in amazing performances.After Devdas and Munna Bhai MBBS, Binod Pradhan has once again shown that as an ace cameraman he is second to none.And what can you say about A.R. Rahman?This time he even sings like a pro.He is paired here for the first time with Prasoon Joshi who makes you think of Majrooh Sultanpuri.But before I forget, I must mention Alice Patten. She is a joy to behold.And she makes a great pair with Aamir.<br/><br/>The film does not have a single dull moment in it.It can be repeated again and again with increasing returns to the viewer.It is a crossover film and needs to be seen by every one in the world.Its publicity and promotion should be geared to that.It should be sent to every international film festival in the world and should be India's entry to the Oscars this year.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Film Review<br/><br/>Rang De Basanti<br/><br/>India Awakens<br/><br/>By Nidhi Kathuria<br/><br/>Rating *****<br/><br/>'Rang De Basanti' gratifies you with uncomplicated, almost melodious humor; it fills any void that Hindi films altogether may have left inside you dry. From the word 'go', this is one film that grips you one hundred percent. It is a film that every Indian should watch. The film simply flows like poetry where characters have the magical ability to bounce into different periods in time and the past and the present conjoin beautifully like a reverie. And in this moment lies the strength that transforms a common man into an uncommon man. He truly becomes an Indian. 'Rang De Basanti' is not a cliché patriotic film. And thank goodness for that! One really needed a break from J.P. Dutta and Anil Sharma brand of films. No more over the top acting, melodrama, reckless display of uncontrollable emotions and forced tear jerker deshbhakti songs. It was about time for a novel storytelling, for someone as passionate a director like Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra to tell and for us to hear and see and become. The actors simply glide through with the story and the screenplay by Kamlesh Pandey, which is the USP of the film. Not to take away any credit, Aamir Khan, Atul Kulkarni, Sharman Joshi, Kunal Kapoor and Siddharth really got into the skin of their characters of ones they are and ones they turn into. Even Soha Ali Khan has given her career's best and her unconventional looks proved only advantageous for the character she plays. What 'Mangal Pandey' couldn't do for Aamir Khan, 'Rang De Basanti' does and more. Madhavan in the cameo gives a true to life performance. Om Puri and Anupam Kher didn't have much to do in the script. Kirron Kher on the other hand was exemplary in her 'pucca Punjaban' character. Veteran actor Waheeda Rehman also did justice to her role. One actor who deserves a special mention is debutante Alice Payton who plays the role of Sue, a filmmaker from London, who wants to make a documentary in India called 'Young Guns of India' based on heroes of Pre-Independence era. Sue wants the boy band to don the roles of Bhagat Singh, Azad, Bismil, Rajguru etc. that only act as a baptism of fire, by virtue of which they find courage and strength that was needed when a cyclone behest their lives and demanded of them to raise their voice; a blast that could be heard by our generation, to shake their souls and have a one voice. And hence the film is beautifully titled 'Rang De Basanti'. The dialogues and lyrics by Prasoon Joshi take the film to another level. While Art Direction and Cinematography of the film almost makes you speechless. Every frame of the film is shot with precision and perfection. Needless to say, the editor has also done a super fine job. And now for the music- A.R. Rehman after the wishy- washy music of 'Mangal Pandey' completely absolves himself. A musical journey that takes you on a roller coaster ride that ends in an Awakening. Well, that's what the film hopes to achieve on some level, without being preachy or affected. Salutations to Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra for giving to our generation a renewed faith and hope, for making us believe that there is a fire kindling in all of ours' souls and no matter where we are and what we do, we love our country.<br/><br/>The Story: A young English filmmaker, Sue (Alice Payton), arrives in Delhi to make a film on Indian revolutionaries and their struggle for independent India. She is supported in her venture by her friend Sonia (Soha Ali Khan). After grilling auditioning sessions, when Sue is almost disheartened and doubts if she will be able to find her heroes at all, she comes across DJ (Aamir Khan), Karan (Siddharth), Sukhi (Sharman Joshi), Aslam (Kunal Kapoor) and Lakshman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni) and she knows she has found what she was looking for. From sheer playfulness, the group gradually starts to feel the pathos the revolutionaries must have experienced in their battles. All these individuals have a different outlook when it comes to sentiments on Nationalism. Ajay (Madhavan) who is an Air Force and plays Sonia's fiancé is instrumental in igniting the fire in them and the events that follow, uproot their indifference towards their country and change their lives forever. <br/><br/>Rating Scale: * Average **Good ***Very Good****Excellent*****Outstanding</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">A British documentary filmmaker gets denied her funding at the last minute. But she has already sacrificed so much for the film, believing strongly in it. It is after all based on a story left to her by her grandfather. So she packs her bags and travels to India to film the documentary even without the help of her studio. There she recruits a bunch of college students to play the key parts and slowly introduces them to the history of their own country, which they have so far dismissed as corrupted and beyond salvation.<br/><br/>What I liked about this film the most is how it juggles its storytelling. We see the young rebels fighting for India's freedom, so in essence the film jumps between two timelines. But it's all channeled through the documentary. The college students play the characters and we're every now and then reminded that this is indeed a film. Which ties it all together very nicely.<br/><br/>The acting is also topnotch. Aamir Khan is as great as always, but all the rest of the main actors are also superb, and varied in the characters they're portraying. This film speaks strongly for an inclusive and all-encompassing India, and it does it well.<br/><br/>I was also surprised by the direction the plot takes. I cannot really speak about it without spoiling it, but suffice to say that the film takes a rather dramatic and even dark turn near the end of the second act. And it's a better film for it. Sure, there will be people that won't like it, believing that the film glorifies this kind of action, but I don't think the film makers intended it that way.<br/><br/>Strong film and one of the better Hindi movies I've seen so far.</div>\n",

I went to see it expecting it to be a little different from the standard escapist fantasies churned out by the Indian film industry (of which I am not a fan). What I got was something so very different from what I had envisioned. The humor,the clichés, the nonchalance of youth, the culture, religion,politics... are all there and the best part is that it works. The storyline though is stretched a bit (we Indians need that) but the message is loud and clear. Throughout the movie a great sense of humor is maintained.The performances are all excellent. <br/><br/>I have given this movie a rating of 10 solely on the basis of the originality of the story. While this movie is definitely not Kurasawa or Satyajit Ray, it is one of the few movies from India which I feel will appeal to both the mainstream and discerning audiences. A movie not to be missed.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">It's about time there has been a Bollywood film about the youth of India. Granted these are college kids and not the average Indian adolescent who sometimes foresakes education for work, they are a good representatives of young Indians both in the diaspora and in India.<br/><br/>Casting is great. Each character pursues their emotion, when their emotions are pursued by circumstances. They express both the emotions at surface and those sunken to be brought out by a situational tide. And they do it with truthfulness. Although some of the elder cast could have been utilized more, the focus on the youth and parallels with past figures are well orchestrated. The character that plays Bhagat Singh, Amir Khan, and Sonia are incredible. Each has their own spotlight where they nudge us from complacency and create an unstable sense of urgency.<br/><br/>This is the best screenplay I have seen thus far in Indian media. Although BLACK had great language through what we saw on the screen, this movie has shown the progress of film- making abroad. Finally! The depth and character development we need are supplied with not just turn of events, but the turn of the screen. We don't need just words to understand a character. This movie shows how well a change in scene isn't a transition but an entity that holds together a character and emotion. And repetition! And repetition of words, dialogue, and attitude through the parallels was very inspiring.<br/><br/>The general storyline of the movie is good. I say good because parts of the youth's leisure sometimes can get annoying as well as the camera-work that accompanies it. At times I wanted to push the film forward and get to the point. But that's the point! Point being that we need to understand the choppy nature of the first half because, chops or not, these characters are transient figures who don't realize their role in life until they have experienced the wholeness of reality. It's interesting that the wholeness comes from reflections of the past. The use and reuse of certain scenes are important in showing the character growth built upon experience.<br/><br/>AR Rahman's music captures the reality unbelievably. We have dance numbers, but they're pathetic belligerent kicking and hand waving. Isn't that what we usually do when we're drunk anyways? Although the use of the music is off sometimes and abrupt, the emotion that each peace carries relates so well to the circumstances. The best use, in my opinion, being Luka Chuppi by Lata M and AR Rahman. The symbiosis between the lyrics and the events on screen are incredible. Dramatic irony at it's best.<br/><br/>The cinematography of this film is great in the majority of the film. The few annoyances in cinematography come with the patchy scenes with the first half during these \"leisure\" rides and early in the second half. But, besides that - the cinematographer and director have made outstanding use of the diagonal view. The lines and profiles of people and country are so well placed that you begin to understand how crooked life's path can be. None of us have a straight line ahead of us. <br/><br/>What makes me enjoy the movie the most is the humor and cause. You'd think with all the aforementioned details that this is a sobering movie about crooked lives and emotions and such, but the characters have fun. Sue's project is hilarious and the use of extras was really earnest. It is very much how I would be acting with friends, of course only when drunk like they are in certain parts. The cause is very important to this film and it makes it a powerful film because it has this cause.<br/><br/>I'm 22. I just recently visited India. I understood and was confused by the youth of India and this film portrays the ambiguity of India well. There are no answers, there are only actions. And this is what they strive to do in the film. Usually Bollywood movies lose their purpose come the 1st dance number, but the truth of this film speaks more than numbers. It is a film about what comes after pure, white innocence of our youth. And it asks that we paint the difference.</div>\n",

Reality is it is a sensible movie which talks to all walks of life.<br/><br/>The balance between ideologies,reality and humor has been taken care off in the most spectacular manner; never making the audience feel small,blamed or negative.<br/><br/>The characters are very real and they do make a lot of sense. The issues that have been touched are topics which we choose not to talk about or act on but at the same time it is no lecture and the light heartedness of the college environment makes you feel nostalgic and calm.<br/><br/>The movie is all about hope. Once again awesome job to the rang DE bas anti team! Peace</div>\n",

The movie has brought out the best performance from each actor. The movie has a very realistic look to it. And to add to the credits for the movie, the direction and the camera angles are simply mind-blowing. I don't think anybody will be satisfied with watching the movie just once. I think the movie is simply EXCELLENT. All those of you who haven't watched it, please do so. The topic that the movie covers is very much relevant and is something that is going on these days in our country.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Sue is a pretty young British lady who wants to make a film about the Indian uprising of the 1920s. This is because she's read through her grandfather's diary and although he was a British officer, he had great respect for these Indian patriots. But her bosses have no interest in such a project (perhaps because she's in the UK), so she takes off for India to do the film herself...with no funding. But because there is no money, she decides to use some college students instead of professional actors. There is a huge problem, though, as the students are mostly very spoiled young people who are more interested in becoming like Westerners than doing a serious film about their forefathers. Can she get through to these jerks and get them to realize the great price that was paid to create modern day India....and thus get the film made?<br/><br/>Like most Indian films, this one is quite long--nearly three hours. And, like a typical Indian film is shows a lot of fun-loving young Indians singing and dancing. I liked the film but think they overdid this aspect a bit. The students should have been oblivious to their past but making them annoying jerks seemed a bit too much, as it was very hard to like any of them during the first portion of the picture. A bit more subtlety would have been nice. Fortunately, through the course of the film, the students did improve in this regard and began to take the project more seriously. This later portion was much better and poignant, as the students start to realize that even today in India there is corruption and repression that must be fought and it's a close parallel to the story about the Indian revolutionaries of the 1920s. I am pretty sure the Indian politicians did NOT appreciate this film and its condemnation of brutal police tactics to squelch protest! Overall, despite being uneven, the film is quite good and interesting as it seems to encourage what might be perceived as terrorism! A very compelling film despite the slow start.<br/><br/>By the way, the MiG-21 crashes which made up a significant part of the latter portion of film have apparently been a serious problem in India. And yet, the film says at the beginning that it's a work of fiction...interesting. Also, for Westerners not used to Bollywood films, you might be interested to hear that corruption (particularly police corruption) is a relatively common theme in Indian films.</div>\n",

It basically tells a story of how truly normal students get ready to even risk their lives in their fight against the system. The performance of Soha Ali Khan was better than I had expected. I specially loved the manner in which the historic events were shown. A truly amazing transformation of normal college students into rebels. Miss it and you will regret it.</div>\n",

For people who thought old values are not for modern days, this sure is an eye opener. An excellent music background score by A.R.Rahman. the cinematography is so damn realistic. Excellent screenplay too. There are certain instances where the screen has more than one event being focused at. This makes the movie more natural and easy to relate to. Siddarth might have done a bit of over-acting. but the sensitive Aamir Khan is at sheer acting epitome. Expecting this to be nominated from India for Oscars. Unlike Dil Chahta Hai it is a more heavy and thought-provoking movie sure to rise Nationalist spirits.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Warning: This is not a movie for he faint hearted or for escapists looking for brainless entertainment.<br/><br/>But if you belong to neither of those categories then this one's for you. As a viewer, I didn't know what to expect from the movie. Sure Aamkir Khan was known for quality cinema and all but Mangal Pandey had come as a huge disappointment and I was thinking that this would follow the same lines. Thankfully, I was wrong.<br/><br/>One of the most different movies ever seen on the Indian Screen, it is a novel experience for the average moviegoer. One cannot really categorize this movie as Action or Romance or Patriotic etc. However, it falls under one category perfectly: Cult. This movie is sure to achieve Cult status especially among the youth. It has scenes from the lives of Bhagat Singh and other Revolutionaries (the sepia tone give it a really authentic feel) as well as the state of the current youth. But what really makes this movie stand out is how it makes a successful comparative study between the Incidents and Events in the Lives of our Pre-Independence Heroes and the Lives of the Modern Youth of India. As this comparison is brought out (especially in the Post-Interval Portions), it makes your skin crawl. Also the climax is an exhilarating experience though it will meet with diverse reactions. <br/><br/>The Story: Sue (Alice Patton in an extremely commendable role) is a British girl who wants to make a movie on Indian Revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad on the basis of the experiences of her grandfather who was an Officer in British India. Due to shortage of money she convinces a mix bag of college students and slackers to act in her movie (Aamir, Siddharth, Sharman Soha Ali Khan, Atul Kulkarni and Kunal Kapoor. While making the movie, she becomes good friends with them and even gets smitten with D.J. (Aamir).<br/><br/>Now these guys have a friend who is an Air Force Pilot (R. Madhavan) whose MiG crashes due to its faulty parts. The entire group is devastated. What angers them further is the Defence Minister's (Mohan Agashe) accusation that the pilot was an amateur. But what really pushes them to the edge is when the Police attacks their peaceful protest march ruthlessly not sparing wither man, woman or child. They decide to take revenge....By killing the Defence Minister. <br/><br/>When they succeed in their endeavour, they are shocked to find the Minister being called a Martyr ad being awarded the Bharat Ratna. They decide tat the country needs to know the truth. For this, they take over an All India Radio Station to announce the truth over the radio. What follows is the tense climax that keeps the viewers guessing till the very end.<br/><br/>Analysis: The movie has been treated in a very contemporary manner. The dialogues have been penned beautifully. The script is tight. If the first half is filled with light moments then the second half has its share serious scenes. The Punjabi Dialogues come as a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>Apart from the main story, there are a number of sub-plots that are included that raise many issues. Be it the views of a Hindu Fundamentalist about Muslims or the views of a Muslim of the treatment given to his community in the country, it makes the viewer think. There is also the love story between Soha Ali Khan and R. Madhavan as well as the controversy regarding the faulty parts in the MiG airplanes purchased by India and the money made by selfish industrialist (Anupam Kher...wasted) and Ministers. <br/><br/>The Music is Excellent. After a hiatus we see A.R. Rahman in full form. The Title Track gives the viewer a sense of elation and the colourful picturisation leaves you wanting more. Also other songs like 'Tu Bin Bataye', 'Paathshala', 'LukaChhupi' and 'Roobaroo' leave an impact on you.<br/><br/>Full Marks to Rakesh MEhra for the treatment of the subject. There are a number of scenes that give you chills like:<br/><br/>1) D.J.'s breakdown at Sue's house after returning from the hospital. 2) Madhavan's last remains brought to his house for his mother and friends. 3) Atul Kulkarni's delivery of the poem 'Sarfaroshi ki Tamanna' as Ramprasad Bismil. 4) the Jalianwalah Bagh Massacre sequence with replacing the Defence Miniter for General Dyer to explain its contemporary relevance.<br/><br/>However, what really makes this movie a true accomplishment is the performances. All of the above would be non-existent if it wasn't for the stellar performance given by the entire cast. Aamir Khan is excellent as the care free Punjabi, but he doesn't steal all the attention. He is supported by equally riveting performances by Siddharth, Kunal Kapoor, Sharman Joshi and Atul Kulkarni. Soha Ali Khan is a revelation compared to her prior films. Her breakdown on hearing of Madhavan's death is one on the most amazing scenes from the movie. Alice Patton is equally good. Her Hindi is sure to strike a chord with the Indian cinegoers. Also, absolutely amazing performances come from Waheedaji and Kirronji. Both lend brilliant support to the movie. <br/><br/>One the whole, this movie is a novel experience. A definite recommendation to every youth of India as well as the World. It is a movie that gives you fodder for thought.

If the story was not forced to match with the past story line then it could have been a enjoyable film but abrupt illogical turns of events actually wasted the real potential of the film.<br/><br/>And the camera crew was trying to make the important scenes more interesting by shaking the frames but they over did that. As a result for those vital scenes camerawork was kind of sloppy and unappealing to the eye.<br/><br/>Bottom line is that, It was an average movie.

As a film, it tries to cover important ground from Indian history, but as with the rest of Bollywood productions, it fails miserably in the attempt.<br/><br/>Strange pacing from beginning to end, and what could be told in less than 90 minutes took almost 180. Awkward rushed editing in spite, an atrociously cheap score, together with several mediocre performances.<br/><br/>To name its few qualities, I thought it did have a slightly interesting developing storyline, as well as decent cinematography and production design with a couple of excellent locations. Aamir Khan brought life to the film with his intuitive wit and impeccable energy as an actor.<br/><br/>Other than that, and as usual from the fiercely overrated Bollywood films in this site, it was a big, long, cheasy mess.</div>\n",

It is definitely one of the best movies I have ever viewed in my life. I find it pretty ridiculous when such a movie is compared to LRMB.<br/><br/>What i favored most about this extravagant movie was that there was an attempt to conveying a message, and the message is revealed very thoroughly. Human beings tend to complain about negative occurrences, ministers, corruption, unemployment, etc...Yet, rarely any one steps up to change what's wrong, and eventually nothing progresses. This movie encourages you to make a difference in society, and change what is erroneous. <br/><br/>EVerything about this movie is just absolutely unique - the screenplay, the colors, the performances, the songs...EVERYTHING. All actors played their roles top-notch. Every actor had an impact in the movie, and should've received equal credit from my perspective. Amir, Sharman, Siddharth, Kunal, Atul, Soha, Waheeda, every one stepped up to the plate. Some actors were over looked,such as Alice Patten and Sharman Joshi. Alice had dedication towards her work - her Hindi was very well fluent, and so were her expressions. Sharman did a great job acting innocently comic. Soha's reaction after Ajay's death was natural - she fitted into the very skin of her character. Siddharth is a fantastic actor, and hopefully will make it big in Bollywood one day, he handled his character to the maximum level. Amir, as usual, did not disappoint. He was awesome, and very authentic. <br/><br/>The movie was modern - so today, and it was something that we can easily relate to. <br/><br/>Honestly, when I first purchased the movie last year, I thought it was an over-rated movie just because of Amir Khan's comeback; nonetheless, after watching it, I was proved wrong. It was just \"wow\", beyond words. I couldn't manage not to cry at the end. THe quotes in the movie were just lovely, and has the possession of very deep meanings.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie deserves a 10, without any questioning. It is a message to the youth of the present era. Get out there - change the negative aspects of the world. This movie DOES NOT ONLY GO FOR INDIANS, however all other countries in south Asia, which contains issues such as corruption, over population, and so forth. I am a Bengali, and the movie impressed me as much as any Indian - because the situations in Bangladesh is alike. Ministers are stealing the country's money, and they are not caring about the people, or doing anything to improve the country. People suffer each day - due to their very actions. It taught me that we should do something about my country's political groups, and Prime Ministers. WHOEVER DID NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE, YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF WHAT YOU ARE MISSING - go watch it! =D.</div>\n",

This is an attempt to awaken the generation X to the reality, to encourage them to make a difference without giving lengthy lectures and preaches on patriotism and nationalism. So, does the film succeed in doing so..?? Well to a large extent it does. The film manages to invoke the feeling for the nation without any heavy dose of loud hardcore patriotic dialogues. The film is a good mix of fun and message. It delivers the message without loosing the essential fun factor. Amir Khan's one liners keep you alive all through. As expected Amir Khan steals the show but the second leads stand out as well with some good performances. Cinematography, direction and screenplay are of first grade. This one also marks A R Rehman's return to form with some marvellous songs and background score. I would have rated it 10/10 only if the climax was handled a bit better. The end of the story leaves a lot to be desired and the moral of the story is not very clear by its climax. A genuine, honest and good attempt nevertheless. See it and feel good, feel proud and feel moved.</div>\n",

It continues on to build up its story in a softer tone and quite literally from scratch. It's a surprise for me this movie actually presents two separate conflicts altogether. What's great about this is that the movie has all its significant characters developed deep enough to mean something in the eyes of the viewers. This is very much true that when the second conflict arrives, it doesn't really need much more duration in building up its content's suspense. What I appreciate even more is that unlike other Indian movies this movie sure uses its duration to the maximum point, reducing the duration of the songs up to minimum. Most of the songs even contain some heavy detail scenes, forcing the viewers, especially those on digital media, not to skip the songs. It's also nice that this movie contains a little bit of assorting genres such as a little bit of action, thriller, and of course romance beside all the heavy drama. The acting side is quite a standard Indian piece, but it can hold as it has a great execution of a great story.</div>\n",

The movie was quite influential to the point that the political scum really need to worry about their safety. Having said all that, there is really nothing in this movie itself besides that which is worth mentioning. Its the standard Bollywood fare of singing, dancing, religion related fighting and a look at the past freedom struggle from the British. All that changes when one of the friends gets killed in an air crash, attributed to low quality spares approved by corrupt politicians. The heroes thus go and kill a politician in broad daylight. The obvious happens and they are hunted down and killed by counter terrorist squads. The end.</div>\n",

I rented it and I started to dislike it after 5 minutes of viewing time but still I was watching it to save the money I spent. It was complete nonsense first a white girl appeared in India and met Aamir Khan who was drinking with his friends on top of a bridge and placed a bet that who ever falls of first into the water is a loser, then he started dancing stupidly with the girl by shaking his waist then his head. After that I couldn't take it anymore and I asked my dad that \"can I eject the DVD now?\" and he replied \"I'm glad you asked\". My dad is really keen in films like Lagaan &amp; Swades and he couldn't even watch it and I wanted to save myself rather than my money. The film is made by the same crappy director who also made the weird Aks and it takes a genius to make a movie this bad. Thank goodness that Rang de basanti did not get a Bafta award.</div>\n",

I learned two things from this movie and the first one is that things will always be the same if we all just sit down and do nothing about it, and the second thing is that we, the people who live in this day and age are a disgrace to our freedom fighters of the past. I don't just mean this for India, but for everywhere in the world where the fight for freedom has been a price selflessly paid by people just like you and I. Rang De Basanti is the story of seven friends, one of whom is a British national who comes to India to shoot a documentary based on the accounts of her grandfather who was a first hand witness to the Legend of Bhagat Singh and his friends. When she reaches India, she is shocked by the way the youth of today seems to have little or no understanding of their very recent past and how Westernised they had all become. She meets six friends, five boys and one girl of which she quickly becomes their 7th. She recruits them to star in her documentary and with this, she unites them all and makes them become aware of what is going on in their surroundings. But maybe her inspiration goes a little too far and by the end of the film, you just have to wonder if she blames herself for what happens and if so how she would live with herself. The element I liked the most about the film, was how in the end, this British girl's life is forever changed as she finds herself the 21st century updated version of the troubled person her grandfather was on those very pages she was inspired by, and those very pages that would haunt her forever.</div>\n",
